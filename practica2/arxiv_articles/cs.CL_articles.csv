2503.17363,Dancing with Critiques: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Stepwise Natural Language Self-Critique,"Yansi Li, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Xingyu Chen, Zhiwei He, Qiuzhi Liu, Rui Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex tasks requiring multi-step logical deductions, remains a significant challenge. Traditional inference time scaling methods utilize scalar reward signals from process reward models to evaluate candidate reasoning steps, but these scalar rewards lack the nuanced qualitative information essential for understanding and justifying each step. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time scaling approach -- stepwise natural language self-critique (PANEL), which employs self-generated natural language critiques as feedback to guide the step-level search process. By generating rich, human-readable critiques for each candidate reasoning step, PANEL retains essential qualitative information, facilitating better-informed decision-making during inference. This approach bypasses the need for task-specific verifiers and the associated training overhead, making it broadly applicable across diverse tasks. Experimental results on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME and GPQA, demonstrate that PANEL significantly enhances reasoning performance, outperforming traditional scalar reward-based methods. Our code is available at this https URL to support and encourage future research in this promising field.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17336,Efficient Intent-Based Filtering for Multi-Party Conversations Using Knowledge Distillation from LLMs,"Reem Gody, Mohamed Abdelghaffar, Mohammed Jabreel, Ahmed Tawfik","Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in conversational AI, enabling open-domain responses in chat-bots, as well as advanced processing of conversations like summarization, intent classification, and insights generation. However, these models are resource-intensive, demanding substantial memory and computational power. To address this, we propose a cost-effective solution that filters conversational snippets of interest for LLM processing, tailored to the target downstream application, rather than processing every snippet. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages knowledge distillation from LLMs to develop an intent-based filter for multi-party conversations, optimized for compute power constrained environments. Our method combines different strategies to create a diverse multi-party conversational dataset, that is annotated with the target intents and is then used to fine-tune the MobileBERT model for multi-label intent classification. This model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, effectively filtering conversation snippets based on their intents. By passing only the relevant snippets to the LLM for further processing, our approach significantly reduces overall operational costs depending on the intents and the data distribution as demonstrated in our experiments.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17287,FastCuRL: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Progressive Context Extension for Efficient Training R1-like Reasoning Models,"Mingyang Song, Mao Zheng, Zheng Li, Wenjie Yang, Xuan Luo, Yue Pan, Feng Zhang","In this paper, we propose \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}}, a simple yet efficient \textbf{Cu}rriculum \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning approach with context window extending strategy to accelerate the reinforcement learning training efficiency for R1-like reasoning models while enhancing their performance in tackling complex reasoning tasks with long chain-of-thought rationales, particularly with a 1.5B parameter language model. \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}} consists of two main procedures: length-aware training data segmentation and context window extension training. Specifically, the former first splits the original training data into three different levels by the input prompt length, and then the latter leverages segmented training datasets with a progressively increasing context window length to train the reasoning model. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}}-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview across all five datasets (including MATH 500, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, Minerva Math, and OlympiadBench) while only utilizing 50\% of training steps. Furthermore, all training stages for FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview are completed using just a single node with 8 GPUs.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17279,CASE -- Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity Measurement,"Gaifan Zhang, Yi Zhou, Danushka Bollegala","The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17247,"KL3M Tokenizers: A Family of Domain-Specific and Character-Level Tokenizers for Legal, Financial, and Preprocessing Applications","Michael J Bommarito, Daniel Martin Katz, Jillian Bommarito","We present the KL3M tokenizers, a family of specialized tokenizers for legal, financial, and governmental text. Despite established work on tokenization, specialized tokenizers for professional domains remain understudied. Our paper offers two main contributions to this area.
First, we introduce domain-specific BPE tokenizers for legal, financial, and governmental text. Our kl3m-004-128k-cased tokenizer uses 9-17% fewer tokens than GPT-4o and Llama3 for domain-specific documents, despite having a smaller vocabulary. For specialized terminology, our cased tokenizer is even more efficient, using up to 83% fewer tokens for legal terms and 39% fewer tokens for financial terms.
Second, we develop character-level BPE tokenizers (4K, 8K, and 16K vocabulary sizes) for text correction tasks like OCR post-processing. These tokenizers keep consistent token boundaries between error-containing and correct text, making it easier for models to learn correction patterns.
These tokenizers help professional applications by fitting more text in context windows, reducing computational needs, and preserving the meaning of domain-specific terms. Our analysis shows these efficiency gains directly benefit the processing of long legal and financial documents. We release all tokenizers and code through GitHub and Hugging Face to support further research in specialized tokenization.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17239,SafeMERGE: Preserving Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models via Selective Layer-Wise Model Merging,"Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Farhan Ahmed, Syed Zawad, Holger Boche","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks can inadvertently erode their safety alignment, even for benign fine-tuning datasets. We address this challenge by proposing SafeMERGE, a post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining task utility. It achieves this by selectively merging fine-tuned and safety-aligned model layers only when those deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. We evaluate SafeMERGE against other fine-tuning- and post-fine-tuning-stage approaches for Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen-2-7B-Instruct models on GSM8K and PubMedQA tasks while exploring different merging strategies. We find that SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other baselines without significantly sacrificing performance, sometimes even enhancing it. The results suggest that our selective, subspace-guided, and per-layer merging method provides an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety in fine-tuned LLMs while outperforming simpler post-fine-tuning-stage defenses.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17222,Automating Adjudication of Cardiovascular Events Using Large Language Models,"Sonish Sivarajkumar, Kimia Ameri, Chuqin Li, Yanshan Wang, Min Jiang","Cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, remain a leading cause of mortality globally, necessitating meticulous monitoring and adjudication in clinical trials. This process, traditionally performed manually by clinical experts, is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to inter-reviewer variability, potentially introducing bias and hindering trial progress. This study addresses these critical limitations by presenting a novel framework for automating the adjudication of cardiovascular events in clinical trials using Large Language Models (LLMs). We developed a two-stage approach: first, employing an LLM-based pipeline for event information extraction from unstructured clinical data and second, using an LLM-based adjudication process guided by a Tree of Thoughts approach and clinical endpoint committee (CEC) guidelines. Using cardiovascular event-specific clinical trial data, the framework achieved an F1-score of 0.82 for event extraction and an accuracy of 0.68 for adjudication. Furthermore, we introduce the CLEART score, a novel, automated metric specifically designed for evaluating the quality of AI-generated clinical reasoning in adjudicating cardiovascular events. This approach demonstrates significant potential for substantially reducing adjudication time and costs while maintaining high-quality, consistent, and auditable outcomes in clinical trials. The reduced variability and enhanced standardization also allow for faster identification and mitigation of risks associated with cardiovascular therapies.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17211,A Language Anchor-Guided Method for Robust Noisy Domain Generalization,"Zilin Dai, Lehong Wang, Fangzhou Lin, Yidong Wang, Zhigang Li, Kazunori D Yamada, Ziming Zhang, Wang Lu","Real-world machine learning applications often struggle with two major challenges: distribution shift and label noise. Models tend to overfit by focusing on redundant and uninformative features in the training data, which makes it hard for them to generalize to the target domain. Noisy data worsens this problem by causing further overfitting to the noise, meaning that existing methods often fail to tell the difference between true, invariant features and misleading, spurious ones. To tackle these issues, we introduce Anchor Alignment and Adaptive Weighting (A3W). This new algorithm uses sample reweighting guided by natural language processing (NLP) anchors to extract more representative features. In simple terms, A3W leverages semantic representations from natural language models as a source of domain-invariant prior knowledge. Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts each sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP anchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that A3W consistently outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17136,CoKe: Customizable Fine-Grained Story Evaluation via Chain-of-Keyword Rationalization,"Brihi Joshi, Sriram Venkatapathy, Mohit Bansal, Nanyun Peng, Haw-Shiuan Chang","Evaluating creative text such as human-written stories using language models has always been a challenging task -- owing to the subjectivity of multi-annotator ratings. To mimic the thinking process of humans, chain of thought (CoT) generates free-text explanations that help guide a model's predictions and Self-Consistency (SC) marginalizes predictions over multiple generated explanations. In this study, we discover that the widely-used self-consistency reasoning methods cause suboptimal results due to an objective mismatch between generating 'fluent-looking' explanations vs. actually leading to a good rating prediction for an aspect of a story. To overcome this challenge, we propose $\textbf{C}$hain-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{Ke}$ywords (CoKe), that generates a sequence of keywords $\textit{before}$ generating a free-text rationale, that guide the rating prediction of our evaluation language model. Then, we generate a diverse set of such keywords, and aggregate the scores corresponding to these generations. On the StoryER dataset, CoKe based on our small fine-tuned evaluation models not only reach human-level performance and significantly outperform GPT-4 with a 2x boost in correlation with human annotators, but also requires drastically less number of parameters.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17126,Modifying Large Language Model Post-Training for Diverse Creative Writing,"John Joon Young Chung, Vishakh Padmakumar, Melissa Roemmele, Yuqian Sun, Max Kreminski","As creative writing tasks do not have singular correct answers, large language models (LLMs) trained to perform these tasks should be able to generate diverse valid outputs. However, LLM post-training often focuses on improving generation quality but neglects to facilitate output diversity. Hence, in creative writing generation, we investigate post-training approaches to promote both output diversity and quality. Our core idea is to include deviation -- the degree of difference between a training sample and all other samples with the same prompt -- in the training objective to facilitate learning from rare high-quality instances. By adopting our approach to direct preference optimization (DPO) and odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), we demonstrate that we can promote the output diversity of trained models while minimally decreasing quality. Our best model with 8B parameters could achieve on-par diversity as a human-created dataset while having output quality similar to the best instruction-tuned models we examined, GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. We further validate our approaches with a human evaluation, an ablation, and a comparison to an existing diversification approach, DivPO.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17073,A Study into Investigating Temporal Robustness of LLMs,"Jonas Wallat, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Adam Jatowt, Avishek Anand","Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate a surprising amount of factual world knowledge. However, their performance on temporal questions and historical knowledge is limited because they often cannot understand temporal scope and orientation or neglect the temporal aspect altogether. In this study, we aim to measure precisely how robust LLMs are for question answering based on their ability to process temporal information and perform tasks requiring temporal reasoning and temporal factual knowledge. Specifically, we design eight time-sensitive robustness tests for factual information to check the sensitivity of six popular LLMs in the zero-shot setting. Overall, we find LLMs lacking temporal robustness, especially to temporal reformulations and the use of different granularities of temporal references. We show how a selection of these eight tests can be used automatically to judge a model's temporal robustness for user questions on the fly. Finally, we apply the findings of this study to improve the temporal QA performance by up to 55 percent.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17039,Summarization Metrics for Spanish and Basque: Do Automatic Scores and LLM-Judges Correlate with Humans?,"Jeremy Barnes, Naiara Perez, Alba Bonet-Jover, Begoña Altuna","Studies on evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge models for automatic text summarization have largely been focused on English, limiting our understanding of their effectiveness in other languages. Through our new dataset BASSE (BAsque and Spanish Summarization Evaluation), we address this situation by collecting human judgments on 2,040 abstractive summaries in Basque and Spanish, generated either manually or by five LLMs with four different prompts. For each summary, annotators evaluated five criteria on a 5-point Likert scale: coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance, and 5W1H. We use these data to reevaluate traditional automatic metrics used for evaluating summaries, as well as several LLM-as-a-Judge models that show strong performance on this task in English. Our results show that currently proprietary judge LLMs have the highest correlation with human judgments, followed by criteria-specific automatic metrics, while open-sourced judge LLMs perform poorly. We release BASSE and our code publicly, along with the first large-scale Basque summarization dataset containing 22,525 news articles with their subheads.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.17003,A Survey on Personalized Alignment -- The Missing Piece for Large Language Models in Real-World Applications,"Jian Guan, Junfei Wu, Jia-Nan Li, Chuanqi Cheng, Wei Wu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their transition to real-world applications reveals a critical limitation: the inability to adapt to individual preferences while maintaining alignment with universal human values. Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16965,When Words Outperform Vision: VLMs Can Self-Improve Via Text-Only Training For Human-Centered Decision Making,"Zhe Hu, Jing Li, Yu Yin","Embodied decision-making is fundamental for AI agents operating in real-world environments. While Visual Language Models (VLMs) have advanced this capability, they still struggle with complex decisions, particularly in human-centered situations that require deep reasoning about human needs and values. In this study, we systematically evaluate open-sourced VLMs on multimodal human-centered decision-making tasks. We find that LLMs receiving only textual descriptions unexpectedly outperform their VLM counterparts of similar scale that process actual images, suggesting that visual alignment may hinder VLM abilities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-only training approach with synthesized textual data. This method strengthens VLMs' language components and transfers the learned abilities to multimodal inference, eliminating the need for expensive image-text paired data. Furthermore, we show that VLMs can achieve substantial performance gains through self-improvement, using training data generated by their LLM counterparts rather than relying on larger teacher models like GPT-4. Our findings establish a more efficient and scalable approach to enhancing VLMs' human-centered decision-making capabilities, opening new avenues for optimizing VLMs through self-improvement mechanisms.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16883,Assessing the Reliability and Validity of GPT-4 in Annotating Emotion Appraisal Ratings,"Deniss Ruder, Andero Uusberg, Kairit Sirts","Appraisal theories suggest that emotions arise from subjective evaluations of events, referred to as appraisals. The taxonomy of appraisals is quite diverse, and they are usually given ratings on a Likert scale to be annotated in an experiencer-annotator or reader-annotator paradigm. This paper studies GPT-4 as a reader-annotator of 21 specific appraisal ratings in different prompt settings, aiming to evaluate and improve its performance compared to human annotators. We found that GPT-4 is an effective reader-annotator that performs close to or even slightly better than human annotators, and its results can be significantly improved by using a majority voting of five completions. GPT-4 also effectively predicts appraisal ratings and emotion labels using a single prompt, but adding instruction complexity results in poorer performance. We also found that longer event descriptions lead to more accurate annotations for both model and human annotator ratings. This work contributes to the growing usage of LLMs in psychology and the strategies for improving GPT-4 performance in annotating appraisals.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16868,Joint Extraction Matters: Prompt-Based Visual Question Answering for Multi-Field Document Information Extraction,"Mengsay Loem, Taiju Hosaka","Visual question answering (VQA) has emerged as a flexible approach for extracting specific pieces of information from document images. However, existing work typically queries each field in isolation, overlooking potential dependencies across multiple items. This paper investigates the merits of extracting multiple fields jointly versus separately. Through experiments on multiple large vision language models and datasets, we show that jointly extracting fields often improves accuracy, especially when the fields share strong numeric or contextual dependencies. We further analyze how performance scales with the number of requested items and use a regression based metric to quantify inter field relationships. Our results suggest that multi field prompts can mitigate confusion arising from similar surface forms and related numeric values, providing practical methods for designing robust VQA systems in document information extraction tasks.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16858,MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering,"Jialin Chen, Aosong Feng, Ziyu Zhao, Juan Garza, Gaukhar Nurbek, Cheng Qin, Ali Maatouk, Leandros Tassiulas, Yifeng Gao, Rex Ying","Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16856,MMCR: Benchmarking Cross-Source Reasoning in Scientific Papers,"Yang Tian, Zheng Lu, Mingqi Gao, Zheng Liu, Bo Zhao","Fully comprehending scientific papers by machines reflects a high level of Artificial General Intelligence, requiring the ability to reason across fragmented and heterogeneous sources of information, presenting a complex and practically significant challenge. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly those involving reasoning with evidence source from single image or text page, their ability to use cross-source information for reasoning remains an open problem. This work presents MMCR, a high-difficulty benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' capacity for reasoning with cross-source information from scientific papers. The benchmark comprises 276 high-quality questions, meticulously annotated by humans across 7 subjects and 10 task types. Experiments with 18 VLMs demonstrate that cross-source reasoning presents a substantial challenge for existing models. Notably, even the top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved only 48.55% overall accuracy, with only 20% accuracy in multi-table comprehension tasks, while the second-best model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, reached 39.86% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique on cross-source reasoning and observed a detrimental effect on small models, whereas larger models demonstrated substantially enhanced performance. These results highlight the pressing need to develop VLMs capable of effectively utilizing cross-source information for reasoning.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16853,Imagine to Hear: Auditory Knowledge Generation can be an Effective Assistant for Language Models,"Suho Yoo, Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee","Language models pretrained on text-only corpora often struggle with tasks that require auditory commonsense knowledge. Previous work addresses this problem by augmenting the language model to retrieve knowledge from external audio databases. This approach has several limitations, such as the potential lack of relevant audio in databases and the high costs associated with constructing and querying the databases. To address these issues, we propose Imagine to Hear, a novel approach that dynamically generates auditory knowledge using generative models. Our framework detects multiple audio-related textual spans from the given prompt and generates corresponding auditory knowledge. We develop several mechanisms to efficiently process multiple auditory knowledge, including a CLAP-based rejection sampler and a language-audio fusion module. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AuditoryBench without relying on external databases, highlighting the effectiveness of our generation-based approach.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16826,When Tom Eats Kimchi: Evaluating Cultural Bias of Multimodal Large Language Models in Cultural Mixture Contexts,"Jun Seong Kim, Kyaw Ye Thu, Javad Ismayilzada, Junyeong Park, Eunsu Kim, Huzama Ahmad, Na Min An, James Thorne, Alice Oh","In a highly globalized world, it is important for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and respond correctly to mixed-cultural inputs. For example, a model should correctly identify kimchi (Korean food) in an image both when an Asian woman is eating it, as well as an African man is eating it. However, current MLLMs show an over-reliance on the visual features of the person, leading to misclassification of the entities. To examine the robustness of MLLMs to different ethnicity, we introduce MixCuBe, a cross-cultural bias benchmark, and study elements from five countries and four ethnicities. Our findings reveal that MLLMs achieve both higher accuracy and lower sensitivity to such perturbation for high-resource cultures, but not for low-resource cultures. GPT-4o, the best-performing model overall, shows up to 58% difference in accuracy between the original and perturbed cultural settings in low-resource cultures.

One of the reasons for this issue is users' lack of understanding in crafting effective prompts that accurately convey their information needs. Meanwhile, the existence of real-world conversational datasets on the one hand, and the text understanding faculties of LLMs on the other, present a unique opportunity to study this problem, and its potential solutions at scale. Thus, in this paper we present the first LLM-centric study of real human-AI chatbot conversations, focused on investigating aspects in which user queries fall short of expressing information needs, and the potential of using LLMs to rewrite suboptimal user prompts. Our findings demonstrate that rephrasing ineffective prompts can elicit better responses from a conversational system, while preserving the user's original intent. Notably, the performance of rewrites improves in longer conversations, where contextual inferences about user needs can be made more accurately. Additionally, we observe that LLMs often need to -- and inherently do -- make \emph{plausible} assumptions about a user's intentions and goals when interpreting prompts. Our findings largely hold true across conversational domains, user intents, and LLMs of varying sizes and families, indicating the promise of using prompt rewriting as a solution for better human-AI interactions.",cs.CL,21/03/2025

However most of the existing methods either need to finetune that the model can only use tools seen in the training data, or add tool demonstrations into the prompt with lower efficiency. In this paper, we present a new Tool Learning method Chain-of-Tools. It makes full use of the powerful semantic representation capability of frozen LLMs to finish tool calling in CoT reasoning with a huge and flexible tool pool which may contain unseen tools. Especially, to validate the effectiveness of our approach in the massive unseen tool scenario, we construct a new dataset SimpleToolQuestions. We conduct experiments on two numerical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K-XL and FuncQA) and two knowledge-based question answering benchmarks (KAMEL and SimpleToolQuestions). Experimental results show that our approach performs better than the baseline. We also identify dimensions of the model output that are critical in tool selection, enhancing the model interpretability. Our code and data are available at: this https URL .",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16745,SPACER: A Parallel Dataset of Speech Production And Comprehension of Error Repairs,"Shiva Upadhye, Jiaxuan Li, Richard Futrell","Speech errors are a natural part of communication, yet they rarely lead to complete communicative failure because both speakers and comprehenders can detect and correct errors. Although prior research has examined error monitoring and correction in production and comprehension separately, integrated investigation of both systems has been impeded by the scarcity of parallel data. In this study, we present SPACER, a parallel dataset that captures how naturalistic speech errors are corrected by both speakers and comprehenders. We focus on single-word substitution errors extracted from the Switchboard corpus, accompanied by speaker's self-repairs and comprehenders' responses from an offline text-editing experiment. Our exploratory analysis suggests asymmetries in error correction strategies: speakers are more likely to repair errors that introduce greater semantic and phonemic deviations, whereas comprehenders tend to correct errors that are phonemically similar to more plausible alternatives or do not fit into prior contexts. Our dataset enables future research on integrated approaches toward studying language production and comprehension.",cs.CL,20/03/2025
2503.16728,Natural Language Generation,"Emiel van Miltenburg, Chenghua Lin","This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language Generation. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest definition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of information through natural language. That information could be stored in a large database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG researchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning (image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG is closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of the field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to determine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under the header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of dialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog Management). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different subfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar methodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of automatically generated text.",cs.CL,20/03/2025
2503.16674,"Through the LLM Looking Glass: A Socratic Self-Assessment of Donkeys, Elephants, and Markets","Molly Kennedy, Ayyoob Imani, Timo Spinde, Hinrich Schütze","While detecting and avoiding bias in LLM-generated text is becoming increasingly important, media bias often remains subtle and subjective, making it particularly difficult to identify and mitigate. In this study, we assess media bias in LLM-generated content and LLMs' ability to detect subtle ideological bias. We conduct this evaluation using two datasets, PoliGen and EconoLex, covering political and economic discourse, respectively. We evaluate eight widely used LLMs by prompting them to generate articles and analyze their ideological preferences via self-assessment. By using self-assessment, the study aims to directly measure the models' biases rather than relying on external interpretations, thereby minimizing subjective judgments about media bias. Our results reveal a consistent preference of Democratic over Republican positions across all models. Conversely, in economic topics, biases vary among Western LLMs, while those developed in China lean more strongly toward socialism.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

However, pharmaceutical industries face high costs (over $1 billion), long timelines, and a high failure rate, worsened by the rediscovery of known compounds. We propose an LLM-based pipeline that acts as an alarm system, detecting prior evidence of antibiotic activity to prevent costly rediscoveries. The system integrates organism and chemical literature into a Knowledge Graph (KG), ensuring taxonomic resolution, synonym handling, and multi-level evidence classification. We tested the pipeline on a private list of 73 potential antibiotic-producing organisms, disclosing 12 negative hits for evaluation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the pipeline for evidence reviewing, reducing false negatives, and accelerating decision-making. The KG for negative hits and the user interface for interactive exploration will be made publicly available.",cs.CL,20/03/2025
2503.16622,Leveraging Large Language Models for Explainable Activity Recognition in Smart Homes: A Critical Evaluation,"Michele Fiori, Gabriele Civitarese, Priyankar Choudhary, Claudio Bettini","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to uncover the inner reasoning of machine learning models. In IoT systems, XAI improves the transparency of models processing sensor data from multiple heterogeneous devices, ensuring end-users understand and trust their outputs. Among the many applications, XAI has also been applied to sensor-based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) recognition in smart homes. Existing approaches highlight which sensor events are most important for each predicted activity, using simple rules to convert these events into natural language explanations for non-expert users. However, these methods produce rigid explanations lacking natural language flexibility and are not scalable. With the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring whether they can enhance explanation generation, considering their proven knowledge of human activities. This paper investigates potential approaches to combine XAI and LLMs for sensor-based ADL recognition. We evaluate if LLMs can be used: a) as explainable zero-shot ADL recognition models, avoiding costly labeled data collection, and b) to automate the generation of explanations for existing data-driven XAI approaches when training data is available and the goal is higher recognition rates.

Iyengar","Language models (LMs) are machine learning models designed to predict linguistic patterns by estimating the probability of word sequences based on large-scale datasets, such as text. LMs have a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including autocomplete and machine translation. Although larger datasets typically enhance LM performance, scalability remains a challenge due to constraints in computational power and resources. Distributed computing strategies offer essential solutions for improving scalability and managing the growing computational demand. Further, the use of sensitive datasets in training and deployment raises significant privacy concerns. Recent research has focused on developing decentralized techniques to enable distributed training and inference while utilizing diverse computational resources and enabling edge AI. This paper presents a survey on distributed solutions for various LMs, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and small language models (SLMs). While LLMs focus on processing and generating text, MLLMs are designed to handle multiple modalities of data (e.g., text, images, and audio) and to integrate them for broader applications. To this end, this paper reviews key advancements across the MLLM pipeline, including distributed training, inference, fine-tuning, and deployment, while also identifying the contributions, limitations, and future areas of improvement. Further, it categorizes the literature based on six primary focus areas of decentralization. Our analysis describes gaps in current methodologies for enabling distributed solutions for LMs and outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for novel solutions to enhance the robustness and applicability of distributed LMs.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

General-purpose LLMs often struggle with hallucinations, where generated responses deviate from authoritative sources, raising concerns about their reliability in religious contexts. This challenge highlights the need for systems that can integrate domain-specific knowledge while maintaining response accuracy, relevance, and faithfulness. In this study, we investigate 13 open-source LLMs categorized into large (e.g., Llama3:70b, Gemma2:27b, QwQ:32b), medium (e.g., Gemma2:9b, Llama3:8b), and small (e.g., Llama3.2:3b, Phi3:3.8b). A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used to make up for the problems that come with using separate models. This research utilizes a descriptive dataset of Quranic surahs including the meanings, historical context, and qualities of the 114 surahs, allowing the model to gather relevant knowledge before responding. The models are evaluated using three key metrics set by human evaluators: context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. The findings reveal that large models consistently outperform smaller models in capturing query semantics and producing accurate, contextually grounded responses. The Llama3.2:3b model, even though it is considered small, does very well on faithfulness (4.619) and relevance (4.857), showing the promise of smaller architectures that have been well optimized.

In this paper, we use a practical financial use case to illustrate applications that handle ""long question-context-answer triplets"". We construct a real-world financial dataset comprising long triplets and demonstrate the inadequacies of traditional metrics.

Currently, many studies focus on improving either generalization or robustness in isolation, without methods addressing both aspects simultaneously, which presents a significant challenge in developing LMs that are both robust and generalized. In this paper, we propose a bi-stage optimization framework to uniformly enhance both the generalization and robustness of LMs, termed UEGR. Specifically, during the forward propagation stage, we enrich the output probability distributions of adversarial samples by adaptive dropout to generate diverse sub models, and incorporate JS divergence and adversarial losses of these output distributions to reinforce output stability. During backward propagation stage, we compute parameter saliency scores and selectively update only the most critical parameters to minimize unnecessary deviations and consolidate the model's resilience. Theoretical analysis shows that our framework includes gradient regularization to limit the model's sensitivity to input perturbations and selective parameter updates to flatten the loss landscape, thus improving both generalization and robustness. The experimental results show that our method significantly improves the generalization and robustness of LMs compared to other existing methods across 13 publicly available language datasets, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

We employ the Greedy Relaxation of the Sparsest Permutation (GRaSP) algorithm to identify causal relationships between user and system utterance strategies, treating user strategies as states and system strategies as actions. GRaSP identifies user strategies as causal factors influencing system responses, which inform Bidirectional Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiCoGAN) in generating counterfactual utterances for the system. Subsequently, we use the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) model to utilize counterfactual data to determine the best policy for selecting system utterances. Our experiments with the PersuasionForGood dataset show measurable improvements in persuasion outcomes using our approach over baseline methods. The observed increase in cumulative rewards and Q-values highlights the effectiveness of causal discovery in enhancing counterfactual reasoning and optimizing reinforcement learning policies for online dialogue systems.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others.

By comparing its performance to ChatGPT-4o, examined in a previous work of the author, the analysis highlights some differences in ethical moderation practices. Gemini 2.0 demonstrates reduced gender bias, notably with female-specific prompts achieving a substantial rise in acceptance rates compared to results obtained by ChatGPT-4o. It adopts a more permissive stance toward sexual content and maintains relatively high acceptance rates for violent prompts, including gender-specific cases. Despite these changes, whether they constitute an improvement is debatable. While gender bias has been reduced, this reduction comes at the cost of permitting more violent content toward both males and females, potentially normalizing violence rather than mitigating harm. Male-specific prompts still generally receive higher acceptance rates than female-specific ones. These findings underscore the complexities of aligning AI systems with ethical standards, highlighting progress in reducing certain biases while raising concerns about the broader implications of the model's permissiveness. Ongoing refinements are essential to achieve moderation practices that ensure transparency, fairness, and inclusivity without amplifying harmful content.",cs.CL,18/03/2025

Existing healthcare data systems are often fragmented and lack a holistic representation of patient trajectories, creating challenges for coordinated care and personalized interventions. Patient Journey Knowledge Graphs (PJKGs) represent a novel approach to addressing the challenge of fragmented healthcare data by integrating diverse patient information into a unified, structured representation. This paper presents a methodology for constructing PJKGs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and structure both formal clinical documentation and unstructured patient-provider conversations. These graphs encapsulate temporal and causal relationships among clinical encounters, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and personalized care insights.

In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework EEG-CLIP that aligns EEG time series and their corresponding clinical text descriptions in a shared embedding space. We investigate its potential for versatile EEG decoding, assessing performance on a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, results show that EEG-CLIP manages to nontrivially align text and EEG representations.

Although it benefits from current retrieval-augmented generation~(RAG) technologies, it still faces two significant challenges: the collection of dispersed evidence and the efficient organization of this evidence to support the complex queries necessary for EBM. To tackle these issues, we propose using LLMs to gather scattered evidence from multiple sources and present a knowledge hypergraph-based evidence management model to integrate these evidence while capturing intricate relationships. Furthermore, to better support complex queries, we have developed an Importance-Driven Evidence Prioritization (IDEP) algorithm that utilizes the LLM to generate multiple evidence features, each with an associated importance score, which are then used to rank the evidence and produce the final retrieval results.

Furthermore, multiple security firms and research institutions have identified critical security vulnerabilities within the model. Although China Unicom has uncovered safety vulnerabilities of R1 in Chinese contexts, the safety capabilities of the remaining distilled models in the R1 series have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. To address this gap, this study utilizes the comprehensive Chinese safety benchmark CHiSafetyBench to conduct an in-depth safety evaluation of the DeepSeek-R1 series distilled models. The objective is to assess the safety capabilities of these models in Chinese contexts both before and after distillation, and to further elucidate the adverse effects of distillation on model safety.

Persona-based simulations hold promise for transforming disciplines that rely on population-level feedback, including social science, economic analysis, marketing research, and business operations. Traditional methods to collect realistic persona data face significant challenges. They are prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging due to privacy constraints, and often fail to capture multi-dimensional attributes, particularly subjective qualities. Consequently, synthetic persona generation with LLMs offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative. However, current approaches rely on ad hoc and heuristic generation techniques that do not guarantee methodological rigor or simulation precision, resulting in systematic biases in downstream tasks. Through extensive large-scale experiments including presidential election forecasts and general opinion surveys of the U.S. population, we reveal that these biases can lead to significant deviations from real-world outcomes. Our findings underscore the need to develop a rigorous science of persona generation and outline the methodological innovations, organizational and institutional support, and empirical foundations required to enhance the reliability and scalability of LLM-driven persona simulations.

Many machine learning based classifiers have been developed to automate detection of different concepts in a given privacy policy, which can help facilitate other automated tasks such as producing a more reader-friendly summary and detecting legal compliance issues. Despite the successful applications of large language models (LLMs) to many NLP tasks in various domains, there is very little work studying the use of LLMs for automated privacy policy analysis, therefore, if and how LLMs can help automate privacy policy analysis remains under-explored. To fill this research gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based privacy policy concept classifiers, employing both prompt engineering and LoRA (low-rank adaptation) fine-tuning, on four state-of-the-art (SOTA) privacy policy corpora and taxonomies. Our experimental results demonstrated that combining prompt engineering and fine-tuning can make LLM-based classifiers outperform other SOTA methods, \emph{significantly} and \emph{consistently} across privacy policy corpora/taxonomies and concepts. Furthermore, we evaluated the explainability of the LLM-based classifiers using three metrics: completeness, logicality, and comprehensibility.

The LLM was tasked with extracting evidence from chosen academic papers to answer specific research questions. We evaluate the models' performance in faithfully reproducing quotes from the literature and subject experts were asked to assess the model performance in answering the research questions. We developed a semantic text highlighting tool to facilitate expert review of LLM responses.
We found that state of the art LLMs were able to reproduce quotes from texts with greater than 95% accuracy and answer research questions with an accuracy of approximately 83%. We use two methods to determine the correctness of LLM responses; expert review and the cosine similarity of transformer embeddings of LLM and expert answers.

However, masked MLE is prone to overfitting and requires self-distillation regularization to improve or maintain performance on out-of-distribution tasks. We demonstrate significant performance gain via the proposed training objective - combined masked MLE and self-distillation - across multiple architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Phi) and datasets (Alpaca, ShareGPT, GSM8K), mitigating overfitting while maintaining adaptability during post-training. Our findings suggest that uncertainty-aware training provides an effective mechanism for enhancing language model training.",cs.CL,15/03/2025

Motivated by these findings, our study investigates whether similar reasoning capabilities can be successfully integrated into large vision-language models (LVLMs) and assesses their impact on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. We consider an approach that iteratively leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight training data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further improve model generalization. Initially, reasoning capabilities were distilled from pure-text R1 models by generating reasoning steps using high-quality captions of the images sourced from diverse visual datasets. Subsequently, iterative RL training further enhance reasoning skills, with each iteration's RL-improved model generating refined SFT datasets for the next round. This iterative process yielded OpenVLThinker, a LVLM exhibiting consistently improved reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for robust vision-language reasoning.

New, and potentially nuanced, classes can be defined with natural language text descriptions in the field, immediately before runtime, without needing to retrain the model. We present an approach for improving non-technical users' natural language text descriptions of their desired targets of interest, using a combination of analysis techniques on the text embeddings, and proper combinations of embeddings for contrastive examples.

While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.",cs.CL,21/03/2025

Schweidtmann","As large language models have shown remarkable capabilities in conversing via natural language, the question arises as to how LLMs could potentially assist chemical engineers in research and industry with domain-specific tasks. We generate dynamic chemical reactor models in Modelica code format from textual descriptions as user input. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B Instruct on synthetically generated Modelica code for different reactor scenarios. We compare the performance of our fine-tuned model to the baseline Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model and GPT4o. We manually assess the models' predictions regarding the syntactic and semantic accuracy of the generated dynamic models. We find that considerable improvements are achieved by the fine-tuned model with respect to both the semantic and the syntactic accuracy of the Modelica models. However, the fine-tuned model lacks a satisfactory ability to generalize to unseen scenarios compared to GPT4o.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16980,Token Dynamics: Towards Efficient and Dynamic Video Token Representation for Video Large Language Models,"Haichao Zhang, Zhuowei Li, Dimitris Metaxas, Yun Fu","Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as token pruning and token merging, often disrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately balance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods result in relatively lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language models. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token reduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number of tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video representation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving spatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations by separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring them into: 1. a concise token base, created by clustering tokens that describe object-level content; 2. a token dynamics map, capturing detailed spatial-temporal motion patterns across grids. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the token base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and spatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token count to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance drop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token reduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression), both effectively representing long token sequences for video-language tasks. Our method offers significantly lower theoretical complexity, fewer tokens, and enhanced throughput, thus providing an efficient solution for video LLMs.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16974,Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks,"Julian Junyan Wang, Victor Xiaoqi Wang","This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term ""G-hacking,"" the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16875,Federated Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction With Large Language Model Augmentation,"Jiangcheng Qin, Xueyuan Zhang, Baisong Liu, Jiangbo Qian, Yangyang Wang","Accurately predicting click-through rates (CTR) under stringent privacy constraints poses profound challenges, particularly when user-item interactions are sparse and fragmented across domains. Conventional cross-domain CTR (CCTR) methods frequently assume homogeneous feature spaces and rely on centralized data sharing, neglecting complex inter-domain discrepancies and the subtle trade-offs imposed by privacy-preserving protocols. Here, we present Federated Cross-Domain CTR Prediction with Large Language Model Augmentation (FedCCTR-LM), a federated framework engineered to address these limitations by synchronizing data augmentation, representation disentanglement, and adaptive privacy protection. Our approach integrates three core innovations. First, the Privacy-Preserving Augmentation Network (PrivAugNet) employs large language models to enrich user and item representations and expand interaction sequences, mitigating data sparsity and feature incompleteness. Second, the Independent Domain-Specific Transformer with Contrastive Learning (IDST-CL) module disentangles domain-specific and shared user preferences, employing intra-domain representation alignment (IDRA) and crossdomain representation disentanglement (CDRD) to refine the learned embeddings and enhance knowledge transfer across domains. Finally, the Adaptive Local Differential Privacy (AdaLDP) mechanism dynamically calibrates noise injection to achieve an optimal balance between rigorous privacy guarantees and predictive accuracy. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCCTR-LM substantially outperforms existing baselines, offering robust, privacy-preserving, and generalizable cross-domain CTR prediction in heterogeneous, federated environments.",cs.CL,21/03/2025

However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16851,Towards LLM Guardrails via Sparse Representation Steering,"Zeqing He, Zhibo Wang, Huiyu Xu, Kui Ren","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language generation tasks, yet their uncontrolled outputs pose significant ethical and safety risks. Recently, representation engineering methods have shown promising results in steering model behavior by modifying the rich semantic information encoded in activation vectors. However, due to the difficulty of precisely disentangling semantic directions within high-dimensional representation space, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: lack of fine-grained control, quality degradation of generated content, and poor interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse encoding-based representation engineering method, named SRE, which decomposes polysemantic activations into a structured, monosemantic feature space. By leveraging sparse autoencoding, our approach isolates and adjusts only task-specific sparse feature dimensions, enabling precise and interpretable steering of model behavior while preserving content quality. We validate our method on three critical domains, i.e., safety, fairness, and truthfulness using the open-source LLM Gemma-2-2B-it. Experimental results show that SRE achieves superior controllability while maintaining the overall quality of generated content (i.e., controllability and quality), demonstrating its effectiveness as a fine-grained and interpretable activation steering framework.",cs.CL,21/03/2025
2503.16833,The Deployment of End-to-End Audio Language Models Should Take into Account the Principle of Least Privilege,"Luxi He, Xiangyu Qi, Michel Liao, Inyoung Cheong, Prateek Mittal, Danqi Chen, Peter Henderson","We are at a turning point for language models that accept audio input. The latest end-to-end audio language models (Audio LMs) process speech directly instead of relying on a separate transcription step. This shift preserves detailed information, such as intonation or the presence of multiple speakers, that would otherwise be lost in transcription. However, it also introduces new safety risks, including the potential misuse of speaker identity cues and other sensitive vocal attributes, which could have legal implications. In this position paper, we urge a closer examination of how these models are built and deployed. We argue that the principle of least privilege should guide decisions on whether to deploy cascaded or end-to-end models. Specifically, evaluations should assess (1) whether end-to-end modeling is necessary for a given application; and (2), the appropriate scope of information access. Finally, We highlight related gaps in current audio LM benchmarks and identify key open research questions, both technical and policy-related, that must be addressed to enable the responsible deployment of end-to-end Audio LMs.",cs.CL,21/03/2025

Recognizing that the Q, K, and V linear projections within the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) module represent a critical computational bottleneck, we strategically focused our efforts on accelerating these operations. We present a tiled matrix multiplication accelerator optimized for such workloads on a Xilinx KV260 on-board FPGA. Key innovations include persistent on-chip storage for one matrix operand, two-level tiling for data reuse, and a systolic-like unrolled compute engine. Implemented via high-level synthesis (HLS) and integrated with DistilBERT for Q, K, V projections, our accelerator achieves significant speedup and energy efficiency gains over CPU baselines. Standalone GEMM benchmarks show up to a 7x speedup over an ARM CPU (PyTorch) and ~200x over naive numpy, with a throughput of up to 3.1 GFLOPs on 768x3072 matrices.

2503.16718,CAARMA: Class Augmentation with Adversarial Mixup Regularization,"Massa Baali, Xiang Li, Hao Chen, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj","Speaker verification is a typical zero-shot learning task, where inference of unseen classes is performed by comparing embeddings of test instances to known examples. The models performing inference must hence naturally generate embeddings that cluster same-class instances compactly, while maintaining separation across classes. In order to learn to do so, they are typically trained on a large number of classes (speakers), often using specialized losses. However real-world speaker datasets often lack the class diversity needed to effectively learn this in a generalizable manner. We introduce CAARMA, a class augmentation framework that addresses this problem by generating synthetic classes through data mixing in the embedding space, expanding the number of training classes. To ensure the authenticity of the synthetic classes we adopt a novel adversarial refinement mechanism that minimizes categorical distinctions between synthetic and real classes. We evaluate CAARMA on multiple speaker verification tasks, as well as other representative zero-shot comparison-based speech analysis tasks and obtain consistent improvements: our framework demonstrates a significant improvement of 8\% over all baseline models.

However, directly applying flow matching to neural vocoders can result in subpar audio quality. In this work, we present WaveFM, a reparameterized flow matching model for mel-spectrogram conditioned speech synthesis, designed to enhance both sample quality and generation speed for diffusion vocoders. Since mel-spectrograms represent the energy distribution of waveforms, WaveFM adopts a mel-conditioned prior distribution instead of a standard Gaussian prior to minimize unnecessary transportation costs during synthesis. Moreover, while most diffusion vocoders rely on a single loss function, we argue that incorporating auxiliary losses, including a refined multi-resolution STFT loss, can further improve audio quality. To speed up inference without degrading sample quality significantly, we introduce a tailored consistency distillation method for WaveFM. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in both quality and efficiency compared to previous diffusion vocoders, while enabling waveform generation in a single inference step.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

Gene42 models utilize a decoder-only (LLaMA-style) architecture with a dense self-attention mechanism. Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data.

While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine.

To address this, we introduce EmpathyAgent, the first benchmark to evaluate and enhance agents' empathetic actions across diverse scenarios. EmpathyAgent contains 10,000 multimodal samples with corresponding empathetic task plans and three different challenges. To systematically evaluate the agents' empathetic actions, we propose an empathy-specific evaluation suite that evaluates the agents' empathy process. We benchmark current models and found that exhibiting empathetic actions remains a significant challenge.

This work explores the potential of leveraging Twitter data for earthquake response analysis. We develop a machine learning (ML) framework by incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze relevant information from tweets posted during earthquake events. The approach primarily focuses on extracting location data from tweets to identify affected areas, generating severity maps, and utilizing WebGIS to display valuable information.

This is largely due to the lack of appropriate datasets, and the difficulty of getting human discussants, moderators, and evaluators involved in multiple experiments. In this paper, we propose a methodology for leveraging synthetic experiments performed exclusively by Large Language Models (LLMs) to initially bypass the need for human participation in experiments involving online moderation. We evaluate six LLM moderation configurations; two currently used real-life moderation strategies (guidelines issued for human moderators for online moderation and real-life facilitation), two baseline strategies (guidelines elicited for LLM alignment work, and LLM moderation with minimal prompting) a baseline with no moderator at all, as well as our own proposed strategy inspired by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation of the problem. We find that our own moderation strategy significantly outperforms established moderation guidelines, as well as out-of-the-box LLM moderation. We also find that smaller LLMs, with less intensive instruction-tuning, can create more varied discussions than larger models. In order to run these experiments, we create and release an efficient, purpose-built, open-source Python framework, dubbed ""SynDisco"" to easily simulate hundreds of discussions using LLM user-agents and moderators.

In this study, we use LLMs to create virtual populations that answer survey questions, enabling us to predict outcomes comparable to human responses. We evaluate several LLMs-including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and versions of the Llama and Mistral models-comparing their performance to that of a traditional Random Forests algorithm using demographic data from the World Values Survey (WVS). LLMs demonstrate competitive performance overall, with the significant advantage of requiring no additional training data. However, they exhibit biases when predicting responses for certain religious and population groups, underperforming in these areas. On the other hand, Random Forests demonstrate stronger performance than LLMs when trained with sufficient data. We observe that removing censorship mechanisms from LLMs significantly improves predictive accuracy, particularly for underrepresented demographic segments where censored models struggle.

Using an individualized and multicultural alignment dataset of over 7,500 conversations of individuals from 74 countries engaging with 21 LLMs, we examined how linguistic attributes linked to constructive interactions are reflected in human preference data used for training AI. We found that users consistently preferred well-reasoned and nuanced responses while rejecting those high in personal storytelling. However, users who believed that AI should reflect their values tended to place less preference on reasoning in LLM responses and more on curiosity.

As the target population for this platform, we focus on patients with cardiovascular diseases who are in a state of multimorbidity, that is, suffering from multiple chronic conditions. We evaluate simulated cases with multiple diseases using a chat application by collaborating with physicians to assess feasibility, efficiency gains through AI utilization, and the quantification of discussion content. We constructed simulated cases based on past case reports, medical errors reports and complex cases of cardiovascular diseases experienced by the physicians. The analysis of discussions across five simulated cases demonstrated a significant reduction in the time required for summarization using AI, with an average reduction of 79.98\%. Additionally, we examined hallucination rates in AI-generated summaries used in multidisciplinary medical discussions. The overall hallucination rate ranged from 1.01\% to 5.73\%, with an average of 3.62\%, whereas the harmful hallucination rate varied from 0.00\% to 2.09\%, with an average of 0.49\%. Furthermore, morphological analysis demonstrated that multidisciplinary assessments enabled a more complex and detailed representation of medical knowledge compared with single physician assessments. We examined structural differences between multidisciplinary and single physician assessments using centrality metrics derived from the knowledge graph. In this study, we demonstrated that AI-assisted summarization significantly reduced the time required for medical discussions while maintaining structured knowledge representation.

However, the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs are often overestimated, as their performance significantly deteriorates in interactive diagnostic settings that require active information gathering. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms behind the performance degradation phenomenon and proposes a solution. We identified that the primary deficiency of LLMs lies in the initial diagnosis phase, particularly in information-gathering efficiency and initial diagnosis formation, rather than in the subsequent differential diagnosis phase. To address this limitation, we developed a plug-and-play method enhanced (PPME) LLM agent, leveraging over 3.5 million electronic medical records from Chinese and American healthcare facilities. Our approach integrates specialized models for initial disease diagnosis and inquiry into the history of the present illness, trained through supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. The experimental results indicate that the PPME LLM achieved over 30% improvement compared to baselines. The final diagnostic accuracy of the PPME LLM in interactive diagnostic scenarios approached levels comparable to those achieved using complete clinical data. These findings suggest a promising potential for developing autonomous diagnostic systems, although further validation studies are needed.",cs.CL,24/02/2025

This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods for enabling digital humans to adopt nuanced personality traits, exploring approaches such as zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. Additionally, it highlights the challenges of integrating LLM-driven personality traits into VR, including computational demands, latency issues, and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for multimodal interactions.

Ten attending physicians at a teaching hospital evaluated this framework, spending approximately 40 minutes on the web-based MATEC application and participating in the 5-point Likert scale survey (rated from 1-unfavorable to 5-favorable). The physicians found the MATEC framework very useful (Median=4, P=0.01), and very accurate (Median=4, P<0.01).

Bennett","This study investigates multimodal turn-taking prediction within human-agent interactions (HAI), particularly focusing on cooperative gaming environments. It comprises both model development and subsequent user study, aiming to refine our understanding and improve conversational dynamics in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs). For the modeling phase, we introduce a novel transformer-based deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously integrates multiple modalities - text, vision, audio, and contextual in-game data to predict turn-taking events in real-time. Our model employs a Crossmodal Transformer architecture to effectively fuse information from these diverse modalities, enabling more comprehensive turn-taking predictions. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving 87.3% accuracy and 83.0% macro F1 score. A human user study was then conducted to empirically evaluate the turn-taking DL model in an interactive scenario with a virtual avatar while playing the game ""Dont Starve Together"", comparing a control condition without turn-taking prediction (n=20) to an experimental condition with our model deployed (n=40). Both conditions included a mix of English and Korean speakers, since turn-taking cues are known to vary by culture. We then analyzed the interaction quality, examining aspects such as utterance counts, interruption frequency, and participant perceptions of the avatar. Results from the user study suggest that our multimodal turn-taking model not only enhances the fluidity and naturalness of human-agent conversations, but also maintains a balanced conversational dynamic without significantly altering dialogue frequency. The study provides in-depth insights into the influence of turn-taking abilities on user perceptions and interaction quality, underscoring the potential for more contextually adaptive and responsive conversational agents.",cs.CL,05/02/2025

XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the ""overthinking phenomenon"". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.",cs.CL,20/03/2025
2503.16356,CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners,"Yunzhi Yao, Jizhan Fang, Jia-Chen Gu, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Nanyun Peng","Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods.

2503.16334,LLM Braces: Straightening Out LLM Predictions with Relevant Sub-Updates,"Ying Shen, Lifu Huang","Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches.

Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

At the same time, they offer a new way of accessing information, mainly through the RAG framework. While there have been notable improvements for the autoregressive models, overcoming hallucination in the generated answers remains a continuous problem. A standard solution is to use commercial LLMs, such as GPT4, to evaluate these algorithms. However, such frameworks are expensive and not very transparent. Therefore, we propose a study which demonstrates the interest of open-weight models for evaluating RAG hallucination. We develop a lightweight approach using smaller, quantized LLMs to provide an accessible and interpretable metric that gives continuous scores for the generated answer with respect to their correctness and faithfulness. This score allows us to question decisions' reliability and explore thresholds to develop a new AUC metric as an alternative to correlation with human judgment.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

Recent studies have proposed emotion-related datasets, frameworks and models to automatically evaluate MT quality of Chinese UGC, without relying on reference translations. However, whether these models are robust to the challenge of preserving emotional nuances has been left largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel method inspired by information theory which generates challenging Chinese homophone words related to emotions, by leveraging the concept of self-information. Our approach generates homophones that were observed to cause translation errors in emotion preservation, and exposes vulnerabilities in MT systems and their evaluation methods when tackling emotional UGC. We evaluate the efficacy of our method using human evaluation for the quality of these generated homophones, and compare it with an existing one, showing that our method achieves higher correlation with human judgments. The generated Chinese homophones, along with their manual translations, are utilized to generate perturbations and to probe the robustness of existing quality evaluation models, including models trained using multi-task learning, fine-tuned variants of multilingual language models, as well as large language models (LLMs). Our results indicate that LLMs with larger size exhibit higher stability and robustness to such perturbations.

To address this critical language gap in medical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking (MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric LLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation mechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric medical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating cross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across language barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle ranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing response times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive evaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms zero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 35.03% increase in accuracy, while maintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.",cs.CL,00/00/0000
2503.16094,Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning,"Reem I. Masoud, Martin Ferianc, Philip Treleaven, Miguel Rodrigues","Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting.

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called TEO (\emph{Two-stage approach on Editing Operation}) for IUR, in which the first stage generates editing operations and the second stage rewrites incomplete utterances utilizing the generated editing operations and the dialogue context. Furthermore, an adversarial perturbation strategy is proposed to mitigate cascading errors and exposure bias caused by the inconsistency between training and inference in the second stage. Experimental results on three IUR datasets show that our TEO outperforms the SOTA models significantly.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a single formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

Furthermore, the limited size of the training datasets also contributes to the insufficient training of the IUR model. To address the first issue, we propose a multi-task learning framework EO-IUR (Editing Operation-guided Incomplete Utterance Rewriting) that introduces the editing operation labels generated by sequence labeling module to guide generation model to focus on critical tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a token-level heterogeneous graph to represent dialogues. To address the second issue, we propose a two-dimensional utterance augmentation strategy, namely editing operation-based incomplete utterance augmentation and LLM-based historical utterance augmentation.

To address this, we present a preliminary evaluation of LLMs in various legal scenarios, covering both Chinese and English legal tasks. Our analysis includes 9 LLMs and 17 legal tasks, with a focus on newly published and more complex challenges such as multi-defendant legal judgments and legal argument reasoning. Our findings indicate that, despite DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 being among the most powerful models, their legal reasoning capabilities are still lacking.

Each instance is labeled with a Satire Level, ranging from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for high-level satire and classified into five distinct Humor Categories: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. The dataset spans multiple languages including English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed variants (Te-En, Hi-En, Ka-En, Ta-En), making it a valuable multilingual benchmark. By introducing DHD, we establish a structured foundation for analyzing humor in deceptive contexts, paving the way for a new research direction that explores how humor not only interacts with misinformation but also influences its perception and spread.

While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality.

Despite its effectiveness, ICL is prone to errors, especially for challenging examples. With the goal of improving the performance of ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that incorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections into the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through self-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on text classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms standard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in the prompt increases. Our findings indicate that CICL introduces confusion by disrupting the model's task understanding, rather than refining its predictions. Additionally, we observe that presenting harder examples in standard ICL does not improve performance, suggesting that example difficulty alone may not be a reliable criterion for effective selection.

To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles.

In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality and managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically filters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across successive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient perplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering criteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model.

However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks.

To address these limitations, we introduce Typed-RAG, a type-aware multi-aspect decomposition framework within the RAG paradigm for NFQA. Typed-RAG classifies NFQs into distinct types -- such as debate, experience, and comparison -- and applies aspect-based decomposition to refine retrieval and generation strategies. By decomposing multi-aspect NFQs into single-aspect sub-queries and aggregating the results, Typed-RAG generates more informative and contextually relevant responses. To evaluate Typed-RAG, we introduce Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset covering diverse NFQ types. Experimental results demonstrate that Typed-RAG outperforms baselines, thereby highlighting the importance of type-aware decomposition for effective retrieval and generation in NFQA.

2503.15850,Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models: A Survey,"Xiaoou Liu, Tiejin Chen, Longchao Da, Chacha Chen, Zhen Lin, Hua Wei","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and transportation. However, their reliability is a major concern, as they often produce plausible but incorrect responses. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

While existing benchmarks have primarily focused on evaluating comprehension through multiple-choice questions, there remains a critical gap in assessing models' generative capabilities in classical Chinese. We introduce Fùxì, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates both understanding and generation capabilities across 21 diverse tasks. Our benchmark distinguishes itself through three key contributions: (1) balanced coverage of both comprehension and generation tasks, including novel tasks like poetry composition and couplet completion, (2) specialized evaluation metrics designed specifically for classical Chinese text generation, combining rule-based verification with fine-tuned LLM evaluators, and (3) a systematic assessment framework that considers both linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant performance gaps between understanding and generation tasks, with models achieving promising results in comprehension but struggling considerably in generation tasks, particularly those requiring deep cultural knowledge and adherence to classical formats. Our findings highlight the current limitations in ancient Chinese text processing and provide insights for future model development.

Previous studies have explored generation methods leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, accurately reproducing the game features of the game descriptions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

The training approaches for current MDS models can be grouped into four approaches: end-to-end with special pre-training (""direct""), chunk-then-summarize, extract-then-summarize, and inference with GPT-style models. In this work, we evaluate MDS models across training approaches, domains, and dimensions (reference similarity, quality, and factuality), to analyze how and why models trained on one domain can fail to summarize documents from another (News, Science, and Conversation) in the zero-shot domain transfer setting. We define domain-transfer ""failure"" as a decrease in factuality, higher deviation from the target, and a general decrease in summary quality. In addition to exploring domain transfer for MDS models, we examine potential issues with applying popular summarization metrics out-of-the-box.",cs.CL,20/03/2025
2503.15737,KoGNER: A Novel Framework for Knowledge Graph Distillation on Biomedical Named Entity Recognition,"Heming Zhang, Wenyu Li, Di Huang, Yinjie Tang, Yixin Chen, Philip Payne, Fuhai Li","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that plays a crucial role in information extraction, question answering, and knowledge-based systems. Traditional deep learning-based NER models often struggle with domain-specific generalization and suffer from data sparsity issues. In this work, we introduce Knowledge Graph distilled for Named Entity Recognition (KoGNER), a novel approach that integrates Knowledge Graph (KG) distillation into NER models to enhance entity recognition performance. Our framework leverages structured knowledge representations from KGs to enrich contextual embeddings, thereby improving entity classification and reducing ambiguity in entity detection. KoGNER employs a two-step process: (1) Knowledge Distillation, where external knowledge sources are distilled into a lightweight representation for seamless integration with NER models, and (2) Entity-Aware Augmentation, which integrates contextual embeddings that have been enriched with knowledge graph information directly into GNN, thereby improving the model's ability to understand and represent entity relationships. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KoGNER achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming finetuned NER models and LLMs by a significant margin. These findings suggest that leveraging knowledge graphs as auxiliary information can significantly improve NER accuracy, making KoGNER a promising direction for future research in knowledge-aware NLP.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Patient Recruitment: the Patient's Point of View,"Mathilde Aguiar, Pierre Zweigenbaum, Nona Naderi","Recruiting patients to participate in clinical trials can be challenging and time-consuming. Usually, participation in a clinical trial is initiated by a healthcare professional and proposed to the patient. Promoting clinical trials directly to patients via online recruitment might help to reach them more efficiently. In this study, we address the case where a patient is initiating their own recruitment process and wants to determine whether they are eligible for a given clinical trial, using their own language to describe their medical profile. To study whether this creates difficulties in the patient trial matching process, we design a new dataset and task, Natural Language Inference for Patient Recruitment (NLI4PR), in which patient language profiles must be matched to clinical trials. We create it by adapting the TREC 2022 Clinical Trial Track dataset, which provides patients' medical profiles, and rephrasing them manually using patient language. We also use the associated clinical trial reports where the patients are either eligible or excluded. We prompt several open-source Large Language Models on our task and achieve from 56.5 to 71.8 of F1 score using patient language, against 64.7 to 73.1 for the same task using medical language. When using patient language, we observe only a small loss in performance for the best model, suggesting that having the patient as a starting point could be adopted to help recruit patients for clinical trials.

RAG has gained interest in radiology, and we previously reported the utility of NotebookLM, an LLM with RAG (RAG-LLM), for lung cancer staging. However, since the comparator LLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its advantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate RAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared NotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment.
Materials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging guidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM with REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on CT findings. Staging criteria included TNM classification, local invasion factors, and resectability classification. In REK+/RAG+, retrieval accuracy was quantified based on the sufficiency of retrieved REK excerpts.
Results: REK+/RAG+ achieved a staging accuracy of 70%, outperforming REK+/RAG- (38%) and REK-/RAG- (35%). For TNM classification, REK+/RAG+ attained 80% accuracy, exceeding REK+/RAG- (55%) and REK-/RAG- (50%). Additionally, REK+/RAG+ explicitly presented retrieved REK excerpts, achieving a retrieval accuracy of 92%.
Conclusion: NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, outperformed its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment, suggesting that RAG may improve LLM's staging accuracy. Furthermore, its ability to retrieve and present REK excerpts provides transparency for physicians, highlighting its applicability for clinical diagnosis and classification.",cs.CL,19/03/2025
2503.15620,Does Context Matter? ContextualJudgeBench for Evaluating LLM-based Judges in Contextual Settings,"Austin Xu, Srijan Bansal, Yifei Ming, Semih Yavuz, Shafiq Joty","The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods.

A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination,"Yifan Sun, Han Wang, Dongbai Li, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang","Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies. Our code repository is available at this https URL.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

In this work, we present an in-depth empirical analysis and demonstrate that, contrary to previous observations, scaling the decoder yields significant performance gains, always exceeding those achieved by encoder scaling alone. We also identify label noise as a key challenge in STR, particularly in real-world data, which can limit the effectiveness of STR models. To address this, we propose Cloze Self-Distillation (CSD), a method that mitigates label noise by distilling a student model from context-aware soft predictions and pseudolabels generated by a teacher model. Additionally, we enhance the decoder architecture by introducing differential cross-attention for STR.

Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. We introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation within news, a context crucial for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated content can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments but diminish diversity in initially heterogeneous contexts. These results illustrate that the initial diversity of an information environment critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation uniformly threatens diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy.",cs.CL,00/00/0000

For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense.

Utilizing on-policy samples, generated directly by the policy model, typically results in better performance due to its distribution consistency with the model compared to off-policy samples. This paper identifies the quality of candidate preference samples as another critical factor. While the quality of on-policy data is inherently constrained by the capabilities of the policy model, off-policy data, which can be derived from diverse sources, offers greater potential for quality despite experiencing distribution shifts. However, current research mostly relies on on-policy data and neglects the value of off-policy data in terms of data quality, due to the challenge posed by distribution shift. In this paper, we propose InCo-DPO, an efficient method for synthesizing preference data by integrating on-policy and off-policy data, allowing dynamic adjustments to balance distribution shifts and data quality, thus finding an optimal trade-off. Consequently, InCo-DPO overcomes the limitations of distribution shifts in off-policy data and the quality constraints of on-policy data. We evaluated InCo-DPO with the Alpaca-Eval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms both on-policy and off-policy data but also achieves a state-of-the-art win rate of 60.8 on Arena-Hard with the vanilla DPO using Gemma-2 model.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

However, the depth of exploration can significantly affect the reasoning performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often bring high costs and lack flexibility, and thus undermine the model's reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two metrics to capture the model's current uncertainty and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand or stop exploration according to the probability. In this way, we balance the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction. We further conduct experiments and analysis on the components of Entro-duction to discuss their contributions to reasoning performance.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

However, since MoE dynamically selects the experts, all the experts need to be loaded into VRAM. Their large parameter size still limits deployment, and offloading, which load experts into VRAM only when needed, significantly increase inference latency. To address this, we propose Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE), a new MoE architecture that is efficient in both communication and VRAM usage. In MoLE, the experts are Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) during training, taking the output of the embedding layer as input. Before inference, these experts can be re-parameterized as lookup tables (LUTs) that retrieves expert outputs based on input ids, and offloaded to storage devices. Therefore, we do not need to perform expert computations during inference. Instead, we directly retrieve the expert's computation results based on input ids and load them into VRAM, and thus the resulting communication overhead is negligible. Experiments show that, with the same FLOPs and VRAM usage, MoLE achieves inference speeds comparable to dense models and significantly faster than MoE with experts offloading, while maintaining performance on par with MoE.",cs.CL,20/03/2025

While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.

2503.15552,Personalized Attacks of Social Engineering in Multi-turn Conversations -- LLM Agents for Simulation and Detection,"Tharindu Kumarage, Cameron Johnson, Jadie Adams, Lin Ai, Matthias Kirchner, Anthony Hoogs, Joshua Garland, Julia Hirschberg, Arslan Basharat, Huan Liu","The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.",cs.CL,18/03/2025
2503.15521,From Divergence to Consensus: Evaluating the Role of Large Language Models in Facilitating Agreement through Adaptive Strategies,"Loukas Triantafyllopoulos, Dimitris Kalles","Achieving consensus in group decision-making often involves overcoming significant challenges, particularly in reconciling diverse perspectives and mitigating biases that hinder agreement. Traditional methods relying on human facilitators are often constrained by scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale, fast-paced discussions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework employing large language models (LLMs) as automated facilitators within a custom-built multi-user chat system. Leveraging cosine similarity as a core metric, this approach evaluates the ability of three state-of-the-art LLMs- ChatGPT 4.0, Mistral Large 2, and AI21 Jamba Instruct- to synthesize consensus proposals that align with participants' viewpoints. Unlike conventional techniques, the system integrates adaptive facilitation strategies, including clarifying misunderstandings, summarizing discussions, and proposing compromises, enabling the LLMs to iteratively refine consensus proposals based on user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ChatGPT 4.0, which achieves higher alignment with participant opinions, requiring fewer iterations to reach consensus compared to its counterparts. Moreover, analysis reveals the nuanced performance of the models across various sustainability-focused discussion topics, such as climate action, quality education, good health and well-being, and access to clean water and sanitation. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLM-driven facilitation for improving collective decision-making processes and underscore the importance of advancing evaluation metrics and cross-cultural adaptability in future research.",cs.CL,03/02/2025
2503.15514,"Superhuman AI Disclosure: Impacts on Toxicity, Fairness, and Trust Vary by Expertise and Persona Attributes","Jaymari Chua, Chen Wang, Lina Yao","As artificial intelligence demonstrates surpassing human performance across real-world tasks, disclosing superhuman capabilities poses challenges for fairness, accountability, and trust. To investigate how transparency impacts attitudes and perceptions, we introduce a grounded and validated set of synthetic personas reflecting diverse fairness concerns and technology acceptance levels. Then we evaluate responses in two contrasting domains: (1) a competitive player in StarCraft II, where strategy and high-skill gameplay often elicit toxic interactions, and (2) a cooperative personal-assistant in providing information. Across numerous interactions spanning persona profiles, we test non-disclosure versus explicit superhuman labelling under controlled game outcomes and usage contexts. Our findings reveal sharp domain-specific effects: in StarCraft II, explicitly labelling AI as superhuman, novice personas who learned of it reported lower toxicity and higher fairness-attributing defeat to advanced skill rather than hidden cheating-whereas expert personas found the disclosure statements irksome but still less deceptive than non-disclosure. Conversely, in the LLM as personal-assistant setting, disclosure of superhuman capabilities improved perceived trustworthiness, though it risked AI overreliance among certain persona segments. We release Dataset X-containing persona cards-including profile attributes, disclosure prompts, and detailed interaction logs, accompanied by reproducible protocols and disclaimers for adapting them to diverse tasks. Our results demonstrate that transparency is not a cure-all: while it reduces suspicion and enhances trust in cooperative contexts, it may inflame resistance or disappointment in competitive domains.",cs.CL,31/01/2025

Sumpter","An important part of data science is the use of visualisations to display data in a way that is easy to digest. Visualisations often rely on underlying statistical or machine learning models -- ranging from basic calculations like category means to advanced methods such as principal component analysis of multidimensional datasets -- to convey insights. We introduce an analogous concept for word descriptions of data, which we call wordalisations. Wordalisations describe data in easy to digest words, without necessarily reporting numerical values from the data. We show how to create wordalisations using large language models, through prompt templates engineered according to a task-agnostic structure which can be used to automatically generate prompts from data. We show how to produce reliable and engaging texts on three application areas: scouting football players, personality tests, and international survey data. Using the model cards framework, we emphasise the importance of clearly stating the model we are imposing on the data when creating the wordalisation, detailing how numerical values are translated into words, incorporating background information into prompts for the large language model, and documenting the limitations of the wordalisations. We argue that our model cards approach is a more appropriate framework for setting best practices in wordalisation of data than performance tests on benchmark datasets.",cs.CL,27/01/2025

Whether the robot should communicate with the human is dependent on several situational factors (e.g., the current human's activity, urgency of the interaction, etc.). We test whether large language models (LLM) and vision language models (VLM) can provide solutions to this problem. We compare four different system-design patterns using LLMs and VLMs, and test on a test set containing 84 human-robot situations. The test set mixes several publicly available datasets and also includes situations where the appropriate action to take is open-ended. Our results using the GPT-4o and Phi-3 Vision model indicate that LLMs and VLMs are capable of handling interaction beginnings when the desired actions are clear, however, challenge remains in the open-ended situations where the model must balance between the human and robot situation.",cs.CL,07/01/2025
2503.15484,Value Profiles for Encoding Human Variation,"Taylor Sorensen, Pushkar Mishra, Roma Patel, Michael Henry Tessler, Michiel Bakker, Georgina Evans, Iason Gabriel, Noah Goodman, Verena Rieser","Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using value profiles -- natural language descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings conditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.",cs.CL,00/00/0000

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability.

However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data.
Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.
Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews.
Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence.

2503.15354,Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification,"Yining Lu, Noah Ziems, Hy Dang, Meng Jiang","Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.",cs.CL,19/03/2025
2503.15351,SPILL: Domain-Adaptive Intent Clustering based on Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models,"I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne","In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning. Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets. Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.",cs.CL,19/03/2025
2503.15299,Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs,"Zorik Gekhman, Eyal Ben David, Hadas Orgad, Eran Ofek, Yonatan Belinkov, Idan Szpector, Jonathan Herzig, Roi Reichart","This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.",cs.CL,19/03/2025

We extend multi-agent multi-model reasoning to generation, specifically to improving faithfulness through refinement, i.e., revising model-generated outputs to remove factual inconsistencies. We investigate how iterative collaboration among multiple instances and types of large language models (LLMs) enhances subtasks in the refinement process, such as error detection, critiquing unfaithful sentences, and making corrections based on critiques. We design intrinsic evaluations for each subtask, with our findings indicating that both multi-agent (multiple instances) and multi-model (diverse LLM types) approaches benefit error detection and critiquing. Additionally, reframing critiquing and refinement as reranking rather than generation tasks improves multi-agent performance. We consolidate these insights into a final ""recipe"" called Multi-Agent Multi-Model Refinement (MAMM-Refine), where multi-agent and multi-model collaboration significantly boosts performance on three summarization datasets as well as on long-form question answering, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our recipe.",cs.CL,19/03/2025
