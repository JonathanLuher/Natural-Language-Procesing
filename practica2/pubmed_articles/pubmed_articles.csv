10.3390/jimaging10080192,RailTrack-DaViT: A Vision Transformer-Based Approach for Automated Railway Track Defect Detection,"Aniwat Phaphuangwittayakul, Napat Harnpornchai, Fangli Ying, Jinming Zhang","Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications.",J Imaging,07/08/2024

Early detection of distant potholes is crucial for timely corrective actions, such as reducing speed or avoiding obstacles, to mitigate vehicle damage and accidents. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes perspective transformation to enhance pothole detection at different distances, focusing particularly on distant potholes. Perspective transformation improves the visibility and clarity of potholes by virtually bringing them closer and enlarging their features, which is particularly beneficial given the fixed-size input requirement of object detection networks, typically significantly smaller than the raw image resolutions captured by cameras. Our method automatically identifies the region of interest (ROI)-the road area-and calculates the corner points to generate a perspective transformation matrix. This matrix is applied to all images and corresponding bounding box labels, enhancing the representation of potholes in the dataset. This approach significantly boosts detection performance when used with YOLOv5-small, achieving a 43% improvement in the average precision (AP) metric at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95 for single class evaluation, and notable improvements of 34%, 63%, and 194% for near, medium, and far potholes, respectively, after categorizing them based on their distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to employ perspective transformation specifically for enhancing the detection of distant potholes.",J Imaging,14/09/2024
10.3390/jimaging10080197,A Multi-Scale Target Detection Method Using an Improved Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network Based on Enhanced Backbone and Optimized Mechanisms,"Qianyong Chen, Mengshan Li, Zhenghui Lai, Jihong Zhu, Lixin Guan","Currently, existing deep learning methods exhibit many limitations in multi-target detection, such as low accuracy and high rates of false detection and missed detections. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm, aiming to enhance the algorithm's capability in detecting multi-scale targets. This algorithm has three improvements based on Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the new algorithm uses the ResNet101 network for feature extraction of the detection image, which achieves stronger feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, the new algorithm integrates Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM), Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS), and Distance Intersection Over Union (DIOU) modules, which improves the positive and negative sample imbalance and the problem of small targets being easily missed during model training. Finally, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is simplified to achieve a faster detection speed and a lower miss rate. The multi-scale training (MST) strategy is also used to train the improved Faster R-CNN to achieve a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the other detection models, the improved Faster R-CNN demonstrates significant advantages in terms of mAP@0.5, F1-score, and Log average miss rate (LAMR). The model proposed in this paper provides valuable insights and inspiration for many fields, such as smart agriculture, medical diagnosis, and face recognition.",J Imaging,13/08/2024
10.3390/jimaging10090215,"Concrete Crack Detection and Segregation: A Feature Fusion, Crack Isolation, and Explainable AI-Based Approach","Reshma Ahmed Swarna, Muhammad Minoar Hossain, Mst Rokeya Khatun, Mohammad Motiur Rahman, Arslan Munir","Scientific knowledge of image-based crack detection methods is limited in understanding their performance across diverse crack sizes, types, and environmental conditions. Builders and engineers often face difficulties with image resolution, detecting fine cracks, and differentiating between structural and non-structural issues. Enhanced algorithms and analysis techniques are needed for more accurate assessments. Hence, this research aims to generate an intelligent scheme that can recognize the presence of cracks and visualize the percentage of cracks from an image along with an explanation. The proposed method fuses features from concrete surface images through a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and curvelet transform handcrafted (HC) method, optimized by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier then uses these features to recognize cracks. This study evaluates several CNN models, including VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50, and various HC techniques, such as wavelet transform, counterlet transform, and curvelet transform for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA are assessed for feature optimization. For classification, XGB, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and category boosting (CatBoost) are tested. To isolate and quantify the crack region, this research combines image thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection with the convex hulls method and forms a novel algorithm. Two explainable AI (XAI) tools, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) are integrated with the proposed method to enhance result clarity. This research introduces a novel feature fusion approach that enhances crack detection accuracy and interpretability. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 99.93% and 99.69% accuracy on two existing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the development of an algorithm for isolating and quantifying crack regions represents a significant advancement in image processing for structural analysis. The proposed approach provides a robust and reliable tool for real-time crack detection and assessment in concrete structures, facilitating timely maintenance and improving structural safety. By offering detailed explanations of the model's decisions, the research addresses the critical need for transparency in AI applications, thus increasing trust and adoption in engineering practice.",J Imaging,31/08/2024
10.3390/jimaging10090208,Task-Adaptive Angle Selection for Computed Tomography-Based Defect Detection,"Tianyuan Wang, Virginia Florian, Richard Schielein, Christian Kretzer, Stefan Kasperl, Felix Lucka, Tristan van Leeuwen","Sparse-angle X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in industrial quality control but leads to an inherent trade-off between scan time and reconstruction quality. Adaptive angle selection strategies try to improve upon this based on the idea that the geometry of the object under investigation leads to an uneven distribution of the information content over the projection angles. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an effective approach for adaptive angle selection in X-ray CT. While previous studies focused on optimizing generic image quality measures using a fixed number of angles, our work extends them by considering a specific downstream task, namely image-based defect detection, and introducing flexibility in the number of angles used. By leveraging prior knowledge about typical defect characteristics, our task-adaptive angle selection method, adaptable in terms of angle count, enables easy detection of defects in the reconstructed images.",J Imaging,23/08/2024
10.1038/s41586-025-08732-6,VDAC2 loss elicits tumour destruction and inflammation for cancer therapy,"Sujing Yuan, Renqiang Sun, Hao Shi, Nicole M Chapman, Haoran Hu, Cliff Guy, Sherri Rankin, Anil Kc, Gustavo Palacios, Xiaoxi Meng, Xiang Sun, Peipei Zhou, Xiaoyang Yang, Stephen Gottschalk, Hongbo Chi","Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS-STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS-STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.",Nature,19/03/2025

Here, LAG3 was found to undergo robust non-K48-linked polyubiquitination upon ligand engagement, which promotes LAG3's inhibitory function instead of causing degradation. This ubiquitination could be triggered by the engagement of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and membrane-bound (but not soluble) fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1). LAG3 ubiquitination, mediated redundantly by the E3 ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, disrupted the membrane binding of the juxtamembrane basic residue-rich sequence, thereby stabilizing the LAG3 cytoplasmic tail in a membrane-dissociated conformation enabling signaling. Furthermore, LAG3 ubiquitination is crucial for the LAG3-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity in vivo. Consistently, LAG3 therapeutic antibodies repress LAG3 ubiquitination, correlating with their checkpoint blockade effects. Moreover, patient cohort analyses suggest that LAG3/CBL coexpression could serve as a biomarker for response to LAG3 blockade. Collectively, our study reveals an immune-checkpoint-triggering mechanism with translational potential in cancer immunotherapy.",Cell,06/03/2025

Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity3, offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1-PD-L1-blocking fusion protein4, for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:NCT04806464.",Nature,19/03/2025

If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells2,3. Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build 'rings' of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world.",Nature,19/03/2025
10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.007,Dietary timing enhances exercise by modulating fat-muscle crosstalk via adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling,"Jianghui Chen, Jing Xiang, Meiyu Zhou, Rongfeng Huang, Jianxin Zhang, Yuanting Cui, Xiaoqing Jiang, Yang Li, Runchao Zhou, Haoran Xin, Jie Li, Lihua Li, Sin Man Lam, Jianfang Zhu, Yanxiu Chen, Qingyuan Yang, Zhifu Xie, Guanghou Shui, Fang Deng, Zhihui Zhang, Min-Dian Li","Feeding rhythms regulate exercise performance and muscle energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.",Cell Metab,12/03/2025

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer.",Methods Mol Biol,00/00/0000

This process is carried out by five membrane-bound complexes collectively known as the respiratory chain, working in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated. We used in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inChlamydomonas reinhardtiicells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes segregate into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochromec.

We present a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns and temporal trends in exposure and attributable disease from 1990 to 2021, featuring substantial methodological updates compared with previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, including improved exposure estimations accounting for specific fuel types.Methods:We estimated HAP exposure and trends and attributable burden for cataract, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, tracheal cancer, bronchus cancer, lung cancer, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and causes mediated via adverse reproductive outcomes for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We first estimated the mean fuel type-specific concentrations (in μg/m3) of fine particulate matter (PM2·5) pollution to which individuals using solid fuels for cooking were exposed, categorised by fuel type, location, year, age, and sex. Using a systematic review of the epidemiological literature and a newly developed meta-regression tool (meta-regression: Bayesian, regularised, trimmed), we derived disease-specific, non-parametric exposure-response curves to estimate relative risk as a function of PM2·5concentration. We combined our exposure estimates and relative risks to estimate population attributable fractions and attributable burden for each cause by sex, age, location, and year.Findings:In 2021, 2·67 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·63-2·71) people, 33·8% (95% UI 33·2-34·3) of the global population, were exposed to HAP from all sources at a mean concentration of 84·2 μg/m3. Although these figures show a notable reduction in the percentage of the global population exposed in 1990 (56·7%, 56·4-57·1), in absolute terms, there has been only a decline of 0·35 billion (10%) from the 3·02 billion people exposed to HAP in 1990. In 2021, 111 million (95% UI 75·1-164) global disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to HAP, accounting for 3·9% (95% UI 2·6-5·7) of all DALYs. The rate of global, HAP-attributable DALYs in 2021 was 1500·3 (95% UI 1028·4-2195·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, a decline of 63·8% since 1990, when HAP-attributable DALYs comprised 4147·7 (3101·4-5104·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population. HAP-attributable burden remained highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, with 4044·1 (3103·4-5219·7) and 3213·5 (2165·4-4409·4) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, respectively. The rate of HAP-attributable DALYs was higher for males (1530·5, 1023·4-2263·6) than for females (1318·5, 866·1-1977·2). Approximately one-third of the HAP-attributable burden (518·1, 410·1-641·7) was mediated via short gestation and low birthweight. Decomposition of trends and drivers behind changes in the HAP-attributable burden highlighted that declines in exposures were counteracted by population growth in most regions of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa.Interpretation:Although the burden attributable to HAP has decreased considerably, HAP remains a substantial risk factor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Our comprehensive estimates of HAP exposure and attributable burden offer a robust and reliable resource for health policy makers and practitioners to precisely target and tailor health interventions. Given the persistent and substantial impact of HAP in many regions and countries, it is imperative to accelerate efforts to transition under-resourced communities to cleaner household energy sources. Such initiatives are crucial for mitigating health risks and promoting sustainable development, ultimately improving the quality of life and health outcomes for millions of people.Funding:Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",Lancet,18/03/2025

Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes.

However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets2. Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.",Nature,19/03/2025

The unfolded protein response alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involves activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) that impedes translation by mRNA decay. We discover that the IRE1α digestion motif is present in insulin mRNA carrying SNP rs3842752 (G>A). This SNP in the 3' untranslated region of INS associates with protection from T1D (INSP). ER stress in beta cells with INSPled to accelerated insulin mRNA decay compared with the susceptible INS variant (INSS). Human islets with INSPshowed improved vitality and function and reversed diabetes more rapidly when transplanted into diabetic mice than islets carrying INSSonly. Surrogate beta cells with INSPexpressed less ER stress and INS-DRiP neoantigen. This explanation for genetic protection from T1D may act instead of or in concert with the previously proposed mechanism attributed to INS promoter polymorphism.,Cell,11/03/2025

Here we revealed a crucial role of S-palmitoylation in regulating ferroptosis through glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a pivotal enzyme that mitigates lipid peroxidation. We identified that zinc finger DHHC-domain containing protein 8 (zDHHC8), an S-acyltransferase that is highly expressed in multiple tumors, palmitoylates GPX4 at Cys75. Through small-molecule drug screening, we identified PF-670462, a zDHHC8-specific inhibitor that promotes the degradation of zDHHC8, consequently attenuating GPX4 palmitoylation and enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity.

We aimed to investigate whether active surveillance could be an alternative for individuals with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.Methods:We performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 12 Dutch hospitals. Individuals with locally advanced oesophageal cancer and a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (ie, no tumour detected with endoscopic biopsies, ultrasound, and PET-CT) underwent active surveillance or standard surgery (ie, oesophagectomy within 2 weeks after reaching clinical complete response). There were no inclusion restrictions regarding comorbidities or performance status, but participants had carcinoma, were age 18 years or older, and were treated with curative intent. Randomisation of hospitals was performed using computer-generated sequences without stratification methods, after an initial phase of all hospitals performing standard surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle (allowing crossover at time of clinical complete response) and an intention-to-treat principle. Non-inferiority was defined as 2-year survival rate for active surveillance of 15% or less below that for standard surgery. The trial was registered within the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR-6803, and the inclusion phase has been completed.Findings:Between Nov 8, 2017, and Jan 17, 2021, 1115 individuals were screened, of whom 309 were included. 198 underwent active surveillance and 111 underwent standard surgery. 242 (78%) participants were male and 67 (22%) were female. Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR 32-48). 2-year overall survival for active surveillance (74% [95% CI 69-78]) was non-inferior to standard surgery (71% [62-78]) after modified intention-to-treat analysis (one-sided 95% boundary: 7% lower). It remained non-inferior in the intention-to-treat analysis (75% [68-80] vs 70% [63-77], one-sided 95% boundary: 6% lower). There were no significant differences in overall survival according to modified intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio 1·14, two-sided 95% CI 0·74-1·78) or intention-to-treat analysis (0·83, 0·53-1·31). The frequency of postoperative complications and postoperative mortality after standard surgery or postponed surgery after active surveillance was similar between groups.Interpretation:Overall survival after active surveillance for oesophageal cancer was non-inferior compared with standard surgery after 2 years. For the long-term efficacy of active surveillance, extended follow-up is required. The results of the present trial could be used for patient counselling and shared decision making.Funding:Dutch Cancer Society (KWF) and Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw).",Lancet Oncol,17/03/2025

Our research reveals that dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), a pyruvate metabolism enzyme, promotes leucine accumulation and sustains mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, DLAT directly acetylates the K109 residue of AU RNA-binding methylglutaconyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (AUH), a critical enzyme in leucine catabolism, inhibiting its activity and leading to leucine accumulation. Notably, DLAT upregulation correlates with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Therefore, we developed an AUHK109R-mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) therapeutic strategy, which effectively inhibits tumor growth by restoring leucine catabolism and inhibiting mTOR activation in vivo. In summary, our findings uncover DLAT's unexpected role as an acetyltransferase for AUH, suppressing leucine catabolism.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional association of diabetes with anemia, as defined by hemoglobin measurement. For the UKB follow-up, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of incident anemia, as defined by hemoglobin levels or diagnosis records, in relation to diabetes. We further assessed the impact of inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use on this association in both populations.Results:Among White people aged 40-69 years in the U.S. and U.K., the adjusted odds of study participants with diagnosed diabetes also having anemia was two to four times higher than in those with normal glycemia. Over a median follow-up of 13.6 years in the UKB, 42,354 people developed anemia. The adjusted HRs for incident anemia comparing diagnosed diabetes with normal glycemia were 3.05 (95% CI 2.90-3.21) for iron deficiency anemia, 3.02 (95% CI 2.51-3.63) for anemia of chronic disease, and 4.88 (95% CI 4.23-5.63) for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Further adjustment for inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use partially attenuated these associations, but they remained strong and significant.Conclusions:Diabetes was associated with several major types of anemia.

Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury3, and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched 'ECM-secreting' (Csmd1-expressing) and 'pro-resolving' (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial-transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution.",Nature,19/03/2025

Manipulating interorgan communication is considered a promising strategy for managing metabolic disease, including steatohepatitis. Here, we report that remote limb ischemic conditioning (RIC), a clinically validated therapy for distant organ protection by transient muscle ischemia, significantly alleviated steatohepatitis in different mouse models. The beneficial effect of limb ischemic conditioning was mediated by muscle-to-liver transfer of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their cargo microRNAs, leading to elevation of miR-181d-5p in the liver. Hepatic miR-181d-5p overexpression faithfully mirrored the molecular and histological benefits of limb ischemic conditioning by suppressing nuclear receptor 4A3 (NR4A3). Furthermore, circulating EVs from human volunteers undergoing limb ischemic conditioning improved steatohepatitis and transcriptomic perturbations in primary human hepatocytes and animal models.

However, it remains unclear how BCL11B suppresses natural killer (NK) cell transcriptional programs. Here, we identified that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 physically interacts with BCL11B, increasing BCL11B stability and the fidelity of DNA methylation maintenance for NK cell-related genes, thereby repressing their expression. Moreover, DNMT1 maintains the epigenetic silencing of a distinct subset of NK cell-related genes independent of BCL11B. DNMT1 inhibition or depletion reprograms T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells into NK-like cells that exhibit more robust antitumor effects than BCL11B-deficient ITNKs and parental CAR-T cells. Moreover, H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27) synergizes with DNA methylation to repress NK cell-related pathways, and combined EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and DNMT1 inhibition potentiates both the reprogramming and cytotoxicity of NK-like cells.

Leflunomide (Lef) can suppress the growth of several tumor and mitigate cardiac remodeling in mice. However, the role of Lef in αPD1-induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we report that Lef treatment inhibits αPD1-related cardiotoxicity without compromising the efficacy of αPD1-mediated immunotherapy. Lef changes community structure of gut microbiota in αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice. Moreover, mice receiving microbiota transplants from Lef+αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice have better cardiac function compared to mice receiving transplants from αPD1-treated mice. Mechanistically, we analyze metabolomics and identify indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), which protects cardiac dysfunction in αPD1-treated mice. IPA can directly bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase expression, thus curtailing the cardiomyocyte response to immune injury.

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8+T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2highCAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models.

Here we identify mutations in TET2 as the most common co-occurring mutation in TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In mice, combined hematopoietic-specific deletion of TET2 and TP53 resulted in enhanced self-renewal compared to deletion of either gene alone. Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice developed serially transplantable AML. Both mice and AML patients with combined TET2/TP53 alterations upregulated innate immune signaling in malignant granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), which had leukemia-initiating capacity. A20 governs the leukemic maintenance by triggering aberrant non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Mice with Tp53/Tet2 loss had expansion of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which impaired T cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, mice and AML patients with combined TP53/TET2 alterations displayed increased expression of the TIGIT ligand, CD155, on malignant cells. TIGIT blocking antibodies augmented NK cell-mediated killing of Tp53/Tet2 double-mutant AML cells, reduced leukemic burden, and prolonged survival in Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice.

Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side.

Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10-3per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates.

Additionally, serum uric acid was found to partially mediate the association between TyG-derived indices and follow-up time. The results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with those of the original analysis.Conclusions:TyG-ABSI, which exhibited the best predictive ability, may serve as a valuable biomarker for the long-term follow-up of individuals with HUA.",J Am Nutr Assoc,20/03/2025

However, its progression from asymptomatic stages to an aggressive disease that ultimately fails to respond to treatments is also dependent on changes of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a prevalent clonal condition of the hematopoietic stem cell whose presence is causally linked to a more inflamed microenvironment. Here, we show in 106 patients with MM that CHIP is frequently co-existing with MM at diagnosis, associates with a more advanced R-ISS stage, higher age and shows a non-significant trend towards lower median hemoglobin. In our cohort the two conditions do not share a clonal origin. Single cell RNA-sequencing in 16 MM patients highlights significant TME changes when CHIP is present: decreased naïve T cells, a pro-inflammatory TME, decreased antigen-presenting function by dendritic cells and expression of exhaustion markers in CD8 cells. Inferred interactions between cell types in CHIP-positive TME suggested that especially monocytes, T cells and clonal plasma cells may have a prominent role in mediating inflammation, immune evasion and pro-survival signals in favor of MM cells. Altogether, our data show that, in the presence of CHIP, the TME of MM at diagnosis is significantly disrupted in line with what usually seen in more advanced disease, with potential translational implications. Our data highlight the relevance of this association and prompt for further studies on the modifier role of CHIP in the MM TME.",Blood,20/03/2025

Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p<0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p<0.05). This experiment demonstrates that the administration of GRE reverses behavioral dysfunction and prevents AD-like symptoms in our rat model.",Rejuvenation Res,00/00/0000

Nrf3 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3) has an established role in regulating redox signaling and tissue homeostasis. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role and mechanism of Nrf3 in injury-induced pathological cardiac remodeling.Methods:Global (Nrf3-KO) and CM-specific (Nrf3△CM) Nrf3 knockout mice were subjected to MI or ischemia/reperfusion injury, followed by functional and histopathological analysis. Primary neonatal mouse and rat ventricular myocytes and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to evaluate the impact of Nrf3 on CM apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis were used to uncover potential targets of Nrf3. MitoParaquat administration and CM-specific adeno-associated virus vectors were used to further confirm thein vivo relevance of the identified signal pathways.Results:Nrf3 was expressed mainly in CMs in healthy human hearts, and an increased level of Nrf3 was observed in CMs within the border zone of infarcted human hearts and murine cardiac tissues after MI. Both global and CM-specific Nrf3 knockout significantly decreased injury-induced mitochondrial ROS production, CM apoptosis, and pathological cardiac remodeling, consequently improving cardiac functions. In addition, cardiac-specific Nrf3 overexpression reversed the ameliorative cardiac phenotypes observed in Nrf3-KO mice. Functional studies showed that Nrf3 promoted neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte, and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS production. Critically, augmenting mitochondrial ROS with MitoParaquat blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling. Mechanistically, a redox regulator Pitx2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) was identified as one of the main target genes of Nrf3. Specifically, Nrf3 binds toPitx2promoter, where it increases DNA methylation through recruiting heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and DNA-methyltransferase 1 complex, thereby inhibiting Pitx2 expression. CM-specific knockdown of Pitx2 blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling, and cardiac-specific Pitx2 overexpression attenuated MI-induced mitochondrial ROS production and CM apoptosis, as well as preserved cardiac functions after MI.Conclusions:Nrf3 promotes injury-induced CM apoptosis and deteriorates cardiac functions by increasing mitochondrial ROS production through suppressing Pitx2 expression. Targeting the Nrf3-Pitx2-mitochondrial ROS signal axis may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for MI treatment.",Circulation,18/03/2025

Diseases associated with fibrosis include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), which are collectively responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Although a few drugs with direct antifibrotic activity are approved for pulmonary fibrosis and considerable progress has been made in the understanding of mechanisms of fibrosis, translation of this knowledge into effective therapies continues to be limited and challenging. With the aim of assisting developers of novel antifibrotic drugs, this Review integrates viewpoints of biologists and physician-scientists on core pathways involved in fibrosis across organs, as well as on specific characteristics and approaches to assess therapeutic interventions for fibrotic diseases of the lung, gut, kidney, skin and liver.

Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections2from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic 'driver' mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, CTNNB1 and KDM6A. The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.",Nature,19/03/2025

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment andPark2-/-signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

Our study presents a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium during the proliferative phase in women with PCOS characterized by overweight and obesity, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared with controls of similar age, weight and body mass index. Analysis of 247,791 isolated endometrial nuclei from 27 biopsies (5 controls and 12 PCOS cases at baseline and 7 after 16 weeks of metformin and 3 after lifestyle intervention) revealed cell-type-specific disease signatures and variations in cellular composition and localization. Samples taken after 16 weeks of metformin treatment and lifestyle management showed extensive recovery of disease-specific endometrial signatures. We linked the specific role of each cell type to clinical features such as hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, and specific cell types to risk of endometrial and metabolic disease. In addition, potential therapeutic targets such as integrin inhibitors were identified and the role of metformin in restoring endometrial health in patients with PCOS was highlighted.

ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that gastric cancer screening or surveillance in asymptomatic individuals over 80 should be discontinued or not started, and that patients' comorbidities should be considered when treatment of superficial lesions is planned.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that a high quality endoscopy including the use of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), after proper training, is performed for screening, diagnosis, and staging of precancerous conditions (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) and lesions (dysplasia or cancer), as well as after endoscopic therapy. VCE should be used to guide the sampling site for biopsies in the case of suspected neoplastic lesions as well as to guide biopsies for diagnosis and staging of gastric precancerous conditions, with random biopsies to be taken in the absence of endoscopically suspected changes. When there is a suspected early gastric neoplastic lesion, it should be properly described (location, size, Paris classification, vascular and mucosal pattern), photodocumented, and two targeted biopsies taken.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP do not recommend routine performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT prior to endoscopic resection unless there are signs of deep submucosal invasion or if the lesion is not considered suitable for endoscopic resection.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for differentiated gastric lesions clinically staged as dysplastic (low grade and high grade) or as intramucosal carcinoma (of any size if not ulcerated or ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated), with EMR being an alternative for Paris 0-IIa lesions of size ≤ 10 mm with low likelihood of malignancy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that a decision about ESD can be considered for malignant lesions clinically staged as having minimal submucosal invasion if differentiated and ≤ 30 mm; or for malignant lesions clinically staged as intramucosal, undifferentiated and ≤ 20 mm; and in both cases with no ulcerative findings.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommends patient management based on the following histological risk after endoscopic resection:Curative/very low-risk resection(lymph node metastasis [LNM] risk < 0.5 %-1 %): en bloc R0 resection; dysplastic/pT1a, differentiated lesion, no lymphovascular invasion, independent of size if no ulceration and ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated. No further staging procedure or treatment is recommended.Curative/low-risk resection(LNM risk < 3 %): en bloc R0 resection; lesion with no lymphovascular invasion and: a) pT1b, invasion ≤ 500 µm, differentiated, size ≤ 30 mm; or b) pT1a, undifferentiated, size ≤ 20 mm and no ulceration. Staging should be completed, and further treatment is generally not necessary, but a multidisciplinary discussion is required.Local-risk resection(very low risk of LNM but increased risk of local persistence/recurrence): Piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin of a lesion otherwise meeting curative/very low-risk criteria (or meeting low-risk criteria provided that there is no submucosal invasive tumor at the resection margin in the case of piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin for pT1b lesions [invasion ≤ 500 µm; well-differentiated; size ≤ 30 mm, and VM0]). Endoscopic surveillance/re-treatment is recommended rather than other additional treatment.High-risk resection(noncurative): Any lesion with any of the following: (a) a positive vertical margin (if carcinoma) or lymphovascular invasion or deep submucosal invasion (> 500 µm from the muscularis mucosae); (b) poorly differentiated lesions if ulceration or size > 20 mm; (c) pT1b differentiated lesions with submucosal invasion ≤ 500 µm with size > 30 mm; or (d) intramucosal ulcerative lesion with size > 30 mm. Complete staging and strong consideration for additional treatments (surgery) in multidisciplinary discussion.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest the use of validated endoscopic classifications of atrophy (e. g. Kimura-Takemoto) or intestinal metaplasia (e. g. endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia [EGGIM]) to endoscopically stage precancerous conditions and stratify the risk for gastric cancer.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (2 biopsies from the antrum/incisura and 2 from the corpus, guided by VCE) in two separate, clearly labeled vials. Additional biopsy from the incisura is optional.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients with extensive endoscopic changes (Kimura C3 + or EGGIM 5 +) or advanced histological stages of atrophic gastritis (severe atrophic changes or intestinal metaplasia, or changes in both antrum and corpus, operative link on gastritis assessment/operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia [OLGA/OLGIM] III/IV) should be followed up with high quality endoscopy every 3 years, irrespective of the individual's country of origin.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that no surveillance is proposed for patients with mild to moderate atrophy or intestinal metaplasia restricted to the antrum, in the absence of endoscopic signs of extensive lesions or other risk factors (family history, incomplete intestinal metaplasia, persistentH. pyloriinfection). This group constitutes most individuals found in clinical practice.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommendH. pylorieradication for patients with precancerous conditions and after endoscopic or surgical therapy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients should be advised to stop smoking and low-dose daily aspirin use may be considered for the prevention of gastric cancer in selected individuals with high risk for cardiovascular events.",Endoscopy,20/03/2025

Patients with low and high risk for PEP and native papilla were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 100 mg diclofenac or 100 mg indomethacin rectally before ERCP. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PEP defined by the Cotton consensus. The intention-to-treat principle was conducted for the analysis.Results:The trial was terminated early for futility after the predetermined first interim analysis. Between June 2023 and May 2024, 1204 patients were randomised into the diclofenac group (n=600) or indomethacin group (n=604). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The primary outcome occurred in 53 patients (8.8%) of 600 patients allocated to the diclofenac group and 37 patients (6.1%) of 604 patients allocated to the indomethacin group (relative risk 1.44; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.16, p=0.074). PEP occurred in 35 (14.2%) of 247 high-risk patients in the diclofenac group and 26 (9.8%) of 266 high-risk patients in the indomethacin group (p=0.124).

Although niraparib can effectively affect its progression, the challenge of drug resistance remains. Herein, niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were constructed to identify the abnormally activated enhancers and associated target genes via RNA in situ conformation sequencing. Notably, the target gene RAD23A was markedly upregulated in niraparib-resistant cells, and inhibiting RAD23A restored their sensitivity. Additionally, abnormal activation of glycolysis in niraparib-resistant cells induced lactate accumulation, which promoted the lactylation of histone H4K12 lysine residues. Correlation analysis showed that key glycolysis enzymes such as pyruvate kinase M and lactate dehydrogenase A were significantly positively correlated with RAD23A expression in ovarian cancer. Additionally, H4K12la activated the super-enhancer (SE) of niraparib and RAD23A expression via MYC transcription factor, thereby enhancing the DNA damage repair ability and promoting the drug resistance of ovarian cancer cells. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that lactic acid accumulation leads to lactylation of histone H4K12la, thereby upregulating SE-mediated abnormal RAD23A expression and promoting niraparib resistance in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting RAD23A as a potential therapeutic target for niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer.",Mol Cancer,19/03/2025

Using the mouse intestine, a striking and tractable model of organ resizing, we find that reproductive remodeling is anticipatory and distinct from diet- or microbiota-induced resizing. Reproductive remodeling involves partially irreversible elongation of the small intestine and fully reversible growth of its epithelial villi, associated with an expansion of isthmus progenitors and accelerated enterocyte migration. We identify induction of the SGLT3a transporter in a subset of enterocytes as an early reproductive hallmark. Electrophysiological and genetic interrogations indicate that SGLT3a does not sustain digestive functions or enterocyte health; rather, it detects protons and sodium to extrinsically support the expansion of adjacent Fgfbp1-positive isthmus progenitors, promoting villus growth. Our findings reveal unanticipated specificity to physiological organ remodeling. We suggest that organ- and state-specific growth programs could be leveraged to improve pregnancy outcomes or prevent maladaptive consequences of such growth.",Cell,14/03/2025

Here, we demonstrate that CD4+but not CD8+anti-TGF-β CAR T cells (T28zT2 T cells) can suppress tumor growth partly through secreting Granzyme B and interferon (IFN)-γ. TGF-β1-treated CD4+T28zT2 T cells persist well in peripheral blood and tumors, maintain their mitochondrial form and function, and do not cause in vivo toxicity. They also improve the expansion and persistence of untransduced CD8+T cells in vivo. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T28zT2 T cells are enriched with TCF-1+IL7R+memory-like T cells, express NKG2D, and downregulate T cell exhaustion markers, including PD-1 and LAG3. Importantly, a combination of CD4+T28zT2 T cells and CD8+anti-glypican-3 (GPC3) or anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR T cells exhibits augmented antitumor effects in xenografts.

This process establishes a hypoxic microenvironment that drives metabolic shifts and epigenetic modifications essential for cartilage development. To replicate this, we engineer a cell-adaptable supramolecular hydrogel that accommodates the extensive volumetric and morphological changes of encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells, facilitating the rapid formation of large multicellular cartilaginous organoids. This adaptation fosters a hypoxic environment and induces metabolic shifts toward glycolysis, increasing lactate accumulation and histone lysine lactylation. Enhanced lactylation on Lysine 18 of Histone H3 promotes chondrogenesis and cartilage matrix deposition by improving the accessibility of chondrogenic genes, while the inhibition of histone lactylation disrupts these processes. Implantation of the ultradynamic hydrogel in large animal cartilage defects results in superior repair compared to less dynamic alternatives, providing insights for effective biomaterial delivery in cell therapies.

Here our analysis combining CRISPR‒Cas9 screening with single-cell RNA sequencing tracking of tumor transition demonstrated that antiandrogen-induced zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8)-dependent epigenetic programming orchestrates NEPC transdifferentiation. Ablation of Zmynd8 prevents NEPC development, while ZMYND8 upregulation mediated by achaete-scute homolog 1 promotes NEPC differentiation. We show that forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) stabilizes ZMYND8 binding to chromatin regions characterized by H3K4me1-H3K14ac modification and FOXM1 targeting. Antiandrogen therapy releases the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex from the androgen receptor, facilitating its interaction with ZMYND8-FOXM1 to upregulate critical neuroendocrine lineage regulators. We develop iZMYND8-34, a small molecule designed to inhibit ZMYND8's histone recognition, which effectively blocks NEPC development.

The coprimary end points were the changes from baseline in the total nasal-polyp score (range, 0 to 4 [for each nostril]; higher scores indicate greater severity) and the mean nasal-congestion score (range, 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity) at week 52. Key secondary end points assessed in the overall population were the loss-of-smell score, the total score on the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; range, 0 to 110; higher scores indicate greater severity), the Lund-Mackay score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), the total symptom score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), and the first decision to treat with nasal-polyp surgery or use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, or both, assessed in time-to-event analyses (individual and composite).Results:In total, 203 patients were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 205 to receive placebo. At week 52, the patients who received tezepelumab had significant improvements in the total nasal-polyp score (mean difference vs. placebo, -2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.39 to -1.74) and the mean nasal-congestion score (-1.03; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.86) (P<0.001 for both scores). Tezepelumab significantly improved the loss-of-smell score (mean difference vs. placebo, -1.00; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.83), SNOT-22 total score (-27.26; 95% CI, -32.32 to -22.21), Lund-Mackay score (-5.72; 95% CI, -6.39 to -5.06), and total symptom score (-6.89; 95% CI, -8.02 to -5.76) (P<0.001 for all scores). Surgery for nasal polyps was indicated in significantly fewer patients in the tezepelumab group (0.5%) than in the placebo group (22.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.09); there was significantly less use of systemic glucocorticoids with tezepelumab (5.2%) than with placebo (18.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27) (P<0.001 for both time-to-event analyses).Conclusions:Tezepelumab therapy led to significantly greater reductions in the size of nasal polyps, the severity of nasal congestion and sinonasal symptoms, and the use of nasal-polyp surgery and systemic glucocorticoids than placebo in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.",Science,21/03/2025

The FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erdafitinib has been approved for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with FGFR2/3 alterations. Despite the initial efficacy of erdafitinib, resistance cannot be avoided. The molecular mechanisms underlying erdafitinib resistance have not been well investigated. Here, genome-wide CRISPR screen is performed and coatomer protein complex subunit α (COPA) is identified as a key target to enhance erdafitinib sensitivity. Functionally, the deficiency of COPA reduces the proliferation of FGFR-altered bladder cancer cells upon erdafitinib treatment. Mechanistically, COPA knockout increases the degradation of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) protein, leading to reduced inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner.

DNAmAA was calculated as residuals from the regression of DNA methylation age on chronological age. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality as secondary outcomes. Proportional odds models assessed the associations between DNAmAAs and CKM stages, and Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the associations between DNAmAAs and mortality. Significant associations were found between DNAmAAs and advanced CKM stages, particularly for GrimAge2Mort acceleration (GrimAA) (odds ratio [OR], 1.547 [95% CI, 1.316-1.819]). Over an average follow-up of 14 years, 1015 deaths occurred. Each 5-unit increase in GrimAA was associated with a 50% increase in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 1.39-1.63), a 77% increase in cardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.46-2.15), and a 42% increase in noncardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.27-1.59). With the lowest GrimAA tertile as a reference, the highest GrimAA tertile showed hazard ratios of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.56-2.45) for all-cause mortality, 3.06 (95% CI, 2.13-4.40) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20-2.29) for noncardiovascular mortality. Mediation analysis indicated that GrimAA mediates the association between various exposures (including physical activity, Healthy Eating Index-2015 score, hemoglobin A1c, etc.) and mortality.Conclusions:GrimAA may serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing CKM stages and mortality risk in individuals with CKM syndrome, thereby informing personalized management strategies.",J Am Heart Assoc,21/03/2025

The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)4maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis5,6, LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell-cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.",Nature,19/03/2025

We show that constitutive expression of Pax3 in postnatal, juvenile mouse skeletal muscle stem cells, a subset of the heterogeneous satellite cell pool highly enriched for myogenic activity, potently induces differentiation. This differentiation-promoting activity stands in contrast to the differentiation-inhibiting effects of Pax3 in the commonly used mouse myoblast cell line C2C12. Pax3 mRNA levels in distinct muscles correlate with the rate of myogenic differentiation of their muscle stem cells. Although Pax3 controls embryonic myogenesis through regulation of the canonical myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) Myf-5, MyoD, myogenin and Mrf4, we find that in postnatal muscle stem cells, ectopic Pax3 expression fails to induce expression of any of these factors. Unexpectedly, overexpression of neither Myf-5 nor myogenin is sufficient to induce differentiation of juvenile stem cells; and knockdown of Myf-5, rather than inhibiting differentiation, promotes it. Taken together, our results suggest that there are distinct myogenic regulatory pathways that control the embryonic development, juvenile myogenesis and adult regeneration of skeletal myofibers.",J Cell Sci,01/08/2010

NRPS bioengineering could lead to the production of siderophore analogs with the potential to interrupt this unique bacterial iron uptake system, endowing the molecules with antimicrobial properties. Acinetobacter baumannii produces the catecholate siderophore acinetobactin to scavenge iron, a nutrient essential for several metabolic processes. Previous studies have reported synthetic analogs of acinetobactin that disrupt iron acquisition by A. baumannii, resulting in inhibition of bacterial growth. To foster a long-term goal of using a chemoenzymatic approach to produce additional analogs, we have targeted the adenylation domain BasE for the incorporation of alternate substrates. Here we report a structure-guided approach to investigate the substrate selectivity of BasE for non-native aryl substrates. Using targeted mutagenesis in the active site of BasE, we generated mutants that catalyze the activation of alternate substrates with catalytic efficiencies comparable to the wildtype enzyme with its natural substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). We further solved structures of these mutants bound to the non-native substrates that illustrate an expanded binding pocket that support the improved promiscuity of BasE. Motivated to develop an approach to produce analogs of acinetobactin, including molecules that could block iron uptake or be readily conjugated to antibiotic cargo, our work aims to develop a structure-guided approach for using catecholate siderophore pathways to incorporate alternate substrates.",J Biol Chem,15/03/2025

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently shown promise in treating liver fibrosis due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which MSCs exert their effects remain unclear. In this study, we explored how human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) contribute to treating liver fibrosis, and revealed a crucial role of ferroptosis in modulating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activity. We found that MSCs primarily promote ferroptosis in HSCs in an exosome-dependent manner. Specifically, MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) deliver miR-499a-5p, which interacts with the transcription factor ETS1, leading to the suppression of GPX4, a key regulator of ferroptosis, thereby reducing the fibrogenic activity of HSCs. Overexpression of ETS1 in HSCs counteracted miR-499a-5p-induced ferroptosis, underscoring the pathway's potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations further identified optimal ETS1-GPX4 binding sites.

The primary endpoint was HCC development. The relationships between viral factors and HCC risk in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients were analyzed separately.Results:Over a median 21.7-year follow-up, 547 patients developed HCC. The relationship between viral factors and HCC risk varied depending on HBeAg status. HCC risk increased with viral load and plateaued at ≥5 log10 IU/mL in HBeAg-negative patients, while showing limited correlation in HBeAg-positive patients. Conversely, HBsAg levels were positively associated with HCC risk in HBeAg-negative patients but negatively associated in HBeAg-positive patients.

Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with a current episode of major depressive disorder meeting DSM-5 criteria, with a score of 14 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at screening who had responded inadequately to two or more therapeutic antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria included having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or current psychosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the decision to prescribe lithium or quetiapine, stratified by site, depression severity, and treatment resistance, using block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes. After randomisation, pre-prescribing safety checks were undertaken as per standard care before proceeding to trial medication initiation. The coprimary outcomes were depressive symptom severity over 12 months, measured weekly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and time to all-cause treatment discontinuation. Economic analyses compared the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments from both an NHS and personal social services perspective, and a societal perspective. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants. People with lived experience were involved in the trial. The trial is completed and registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN16387615.Findings:Between Dec 5, 2016, and July 26, 2021, 212 participants (97 [46%] male gender and 115 [54%] female gender) were randomly assigned to the decision to prescribe quetiapine (n=107) or lithium (n=105). The mean age of participants was 42·4 years (SD 14·0 years) and 188 (89%) of 212 participants were White, seven (3%) were of mixed ethnicity, nine (4%) participants were Asian, four (2%) were Black, three (1%) were of Other ethnicity, and ethnicity was not recorded for one (1%) participant. Participants in the quetiapine group had a significantly lower overall burden of depressive symptom severity than participants in the lithium group (area under the between-group differences curve -68·36 [95% CI -129·95 to -6·76; p=0·0296). Time to discontinuation did not significantly differ between the two groups. Quetiapine was more cost-effective than lithium. 32 serious adverse events were recorded in 18 participants, one of which was deemed possibly related to the trial medication in a female participant in the lithium group. The most common serious adverse event was overdose, occurring in three (3%) of 107 participants in the quetiapine group (seven events) and three (3%) of 105 participants in the lithium group (five events).Interpretation:Results of the trial suggest that quetiapine is more clinically effective than lithium as a first-line augmentation option for reducing symptoms of depression in the long-term management of treatment-resistant depression, and is probably more cost-effective than lithium.Funding:National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",Lancet Psychiatry,00/00/0000

Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved1: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis2, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an 'entropy switch', removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.",Nature,19/03/2025

Immune system dysregulation and inflammation, particularly microglial mediated, may underlie this risk, but mechanisms remain unclear.Methods:Using a high-fat diet-fed (HFD) model, we assessed longitudinal metabolism and cognition, and terminal inflammation and brain spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, we performed hippocampal spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing of post mortem tissue from AD and T2D human subjects versus controls.Results:HFD induced progressive metabolic and CI with terminal inflammatory changes, and dysmetabolic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory gene expression profiles, particularly in microglia. AD and T2D human subjects had similar gene expression changes, including in secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), a pro-inflammatory gene associated with AD.Discussion:These data show that metabolic stressors cause early and progressive CI, with inflammatory changes that promote disease. They also indicate a role for microglia, particularly microglial SPP1, in CI.Highlights:Metabolic stress causes persistent metabolic and cognitive impairments in mice. Murine and human brain spatial transcriptomics align and indicate a pro-inflammatory milieu. Transcriptomic data indicate a role for microglial-mediated inflammatory mechanisms. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 emerged as a potential target of interest in metabolically driven cognitive impairment.",Alzheimers Dement,00/00/0000

Technology offers an accessible and cost-effective implementation method for interventions, yet the study of the effectiveness of interventions to date has been specific to the mode of delivery, population, or behavior.Objective:The primary aim of this review was to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of digital lifestyle interventions for improving symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being as coprimary outcomes in adults. The secondary aim was to explore the technological, methodological, intervention-specific, and population-specific characteristics that were associated with major changes in mental health outcomes.Methods:A systematic search was conducted across the MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases to identify studies published between January 2013 and January 2023. Randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions (physical activity, sleep, and diet) that were delivered digitally; reported changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, or well-being in adults (aged ≥18 years); and were published in English were included. Multiple authors independently extracted data, which was evaluated using the 2011 Levels of Evidence from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was the change in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being as measured by validated self-report of clinician-administered outcomes from pre- to postintervention. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether results differed based on the target lifestyle behavior, delivery method, digital features, design features, or population characteristics.Results:Of the 14,356 studies identified, 61 (0.42%) were included. Digital lifestyle interventions had a significant small-to-medium effect on depression (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.37; P<.001), a small effect on anxiety (SMD -0.29; P<.001) and stress (SMD -0.17; P=.04), and no effect on well-being (SMD 0.14; P=.15). Subgroup analyses generally suggested that effects were similar regardless of the delivery method or features used, the duration and frequency of the intervention, the population, or the lifestyle behavior targeted.Conclusions:Overall, these results indicate that delivering lifestyle interventions via a range of digital methods can have significant positive effects on depression (P<.001), anxiety (P<.001), and stress (P=.04) for a broad range of populations, while effects on well-being are inconclusive. Future research should explore how these interventions can be effectively implemented and embedded within health care with a concerted focus on addressing digital health equity.Trial registration:PROSPERO CRD42023428908; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023428908.",J Med Internet Res,20/03/2025

Most patients with DS harbor loss-of-function mutations in one copy ofSCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV)1.1 alpha subunit and has been associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Here, we generated a split-intein form ofSCN1Aand used a dual-vector delivery approach to circumvent adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging limitations. In addition, we applied previously developed enhancer technology to produce an interneuron-specific gene replacement therapy for DS, called DLX2.0-SCN1A. The split-inteinSCN1Avectors produced full-length NaV1.1 protein, and functional sodium channels were recorded in HEK293 cells in vitro. Administration of dual DLX2.0-SCN1AAAVs to wild-type mice produced full-length, reconstituted human protein by Western blot and telencephalic interneuron-specific and dose-dependent NaV1.1 expression by immunohistochemistry. These vectors also conferred strong dose-dependent protection against postnatal mortality and seizures inScn1afl/+;Meox2-CreandScn1a+/R613XDS mouse models. Injection of single or dual DLX2.0-SCN1AAAVs into wild-type mice did not result in increased mortality, weight loss, or gliosis as measured by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, expression ofSCN1Ain all neurons driven by the humanSYNAPSIN Ipromoter caused an adverse effect marked by increased mortality in the preweaning period, before disease onset. These findings demonstrate proof of concept that interneuron-specific AAV-mediatedSCN1Agene replacement can rescue DS phenotypes in mouse models and suggest that it could be a therapeutic approach for patients with DS.",Sci Transl Med,19/03/2025

No therapy is available for the condition except for a lifelong gluten-free diet. To address this gap, we explored the therapeutic potential of regulatory T cells (Tregs). By orthotopic replacement of T cell receptors (TCRs) through homology-directed repair, we generated gluten-reactive HLA-DQ2.5-restricted CD4+engineered (e) T effector cells (Teffs) and eTregsand performed in vivo experiments in HLA-DQ2.5 transgenic mice. Of five validated TCRs, TCRs specific for two immunodominant and deamidated gluten epitopes (DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-α2) were selected for further evaluation. CD4+eTeffsexposed to deamidated gluten through oral gavage colocalized with dendritic and B cells in the Peyer's patches and gut-draining lymph nodes and specifically migrated to the intestine. The suppressive function of human eTregscorrelated with high TCR functional activity. eTregsspecific for one epitope suppressed the proliferation and gut migration of CD4+eTeffsspecific for the same and the other gluten epitope, demonstrating bystander suppression. The suppression requires an antigen-specific activation of eTregsgiven that polyclonal Tregsfailed to suppress CD4+eTeffs. These findings highlight the potential of gluten-reactive eTregsas a therapeutic for celiac disease.",Sci Transl Med,19/03/2025

This study aims to identify potential drug targets for hypertension.Methods:Mendelian randomization was used to identify therapeutic targets for hypertension. Genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci from the eQTLGen Consortium served as genetic instruments. Colocalization analysis evaluated the likelihood of shared causal variants between single-nucleotide polymorphisms influencing hypertension and gene expression. Survival analysis of UK Biobank data assessed hypertension and mortality risks across participants with different gene alleles.Results:Mendelian randomization analysis identified 190 drug targets in the discovery cohort and 65 in the replication cohort after multiple testing correction. Colocalization analysis identified 14 hypertension-related drug targets, including angiotensin-converting enzyme, AIMP1, CDC25A, EHMT2, FES, GPX1, GRK4, HSD3B7, NEK4, PTPN12, SIK2, SLC22A4, SLC2A4, and TNFSF12. Survival analysis revealed individuals with the A allele at rs4308 in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene had a higher incidence of hypertension, while those with the T allele at rs11242109 in theSLC22A4gene showed a lower hypertension-specific mortality rate.Conclusions:Drug target Mendelian randomization studies offer new directions for hypertension treatment, providing insights into its mechanisms and robust targets for developing antihypertensive drugs.",Hypertension,20/03/2025

It is well known that aging affects fracture healing. However, the exact pathophysiology of age-related changes in angiogenesis, inflammation and bone remodeling remains still elusive. Therefore, we herein studied the differences of femoral fracture healing in young adult (3-4 months) and aged (16-18 months) CD-1 mice by using a stable closed femoral fracture model with intramedullary screw fixation. The callus tissue was analyzed by means of X-ray, micro-computed tomography (µCT), histology and immunohistochemistry. We found a deteriorated trabecular architecture and a reduced bone formation within the callus tissue of aged mice. Moreover, aged animals showed an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts at an early healing time point, whereas the fraction of mature α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive microvessels was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the numbers of macrophages and granulocytes were higher in the callus tissue of aged animals at the end of the healing process. Taken together, these results demonstrate a delayed femoral fracture healing in aged CD-1 mice. This is most likely caused by an early overshooting osteoclast response, a decelerated maturation of the callus microvasculature and a late increased recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells. Targeting these alterations may contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches for the stimulation of bone regeneration in geriatric patients.",Geroscience,19/03/2025

However, the binding targets and downstream signaling mechanisms of bilirubin remain unclear. Here, by using quantitative phosphorylation proteomics and several powerful chemical biology techniques such as the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), molecular docking, and MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), it is identified and confirmed that with-no-lysine (K) kinase 1 (WNK1) is the primary target of bilirubin at physiological concentrations. Bilirubin binds to the kinase domain of WNK1, activating its kinase activity and increasing the intracellular chloride ion concentration via the downstream SPAK/OSR1-KCC2 pathway in neurons. Manipulating endogenous bilirubin levels by deleting Blvra, the bilirubin synthesis enzyme, and Ugt1a1, its metabolic enzyme, significantly promotes and inhibits the activation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome, respectively, in mouse hippocampus. Similarly, exogenous bilirubin supplementation suppressed LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse hippocampus in a WNK1-dependent manner. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of WNK1 downstream signaling elucidated the broad biological roles of WNK1, notably its function in suppressing inflammation.

HISTOLOGY OF THE DISEASE, WITH A NOTE ON THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY",E W Hurst,"The histology of pseudorabies differs materially in various animal species. In the rabbit, subcutaneous, intradermal or intramuscular inoculation leads to local inflammation and necrosis. The infection ascends the peripheral nerve (possibly both interstitially and by the axis-cylinders) to the corresponding spinal ganglia and segments of the spinal cord, where primary degeneration of nerve and glial cells takes place. The nerve cell changes are probably responsible for the cardinal symptom of the disease, itching. Death ensues soon after virus reaches the medulla, before visible changes have been produced here. Intracerebral inoculation is followed by characteristic lesions in the meninges, in subpial glial cells and in superficially placed nerve cells. Morbid changes in the lungs are not necessarily related to the presence of virus, but specific lesions may be present. Intranuclear inclusions bearing some resemblance to those in herpetic encephalitis, yellow fever, etc., occur in cells derived from all embryonic layers. The disease in the guinea pig resembles closely that in the rabbit and is modified only by the slightly greater resistance of the animal. In the monkey after intracerebral inoculation, widespread degeneration and necrosis of cortical nerve cells are accompanied by the appearance of specific nuclear alterations in nerve and glial cells, but not in cells of mesodermal origin. No lesions are found in other viscera. In the spontaneous disease in the cow lesions approximate more closely to those in the monkey than to those in the rabbit. In the pig vascular and interstitial lesions predominate, nerve cell degeneration is relatively slight and typical inclusions are not observed. These differences probably explain the benign course of the malady following subcutaneous inoculation in this animal. The lymphatic system, too, participates in the reaction to the virus.",J Exp Med,30/09/1933

It remains unclear whether cardiomyocyte ferroptosis occurs as a consequence of Hippo pathway activation. Using a mouse model of DCM by overexpression of Mst1 transgene (Mst1-TG) leading to Hippo pathway activation, we showed that cardiomyocyte ferroptosis was evident by transcriptomic profiles, elevated mitochondrial Fe2+content, increased levels of lipid peroxidation and obvious mitochondrial damage. Transcriptome revealed significant alterations of genes participating in iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Treatment of Mst1-TG mice with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 reduced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and improved cardiac function. Using heart samples from human patients with DCM, we also found significant cardiomyocyte loss and lipid peroxidation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, ferroptosis was induced by treatment with erastin or YAP inhibitor verteporfin, and cell ferroptosis under these conditions was largely prevented by either iron chelation or Mst1 gene knockdown. In a strain of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte inactivation of Mst1 (dnMst1-TG), erastin-induced ferroptosis and cardiac dysfunction, seen in control mice, were mitigated. Mechanistically, nuclear YAP and YY1 were shown to interact and bind to the Nfs1 promoter, thus mediating downregulation of Nfs1 (encoding cysteine desulfurase). Subsequent inhibition of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthesis promoted cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and DCM phenotype. Restoration of Nfs1 expression was achieved by treatment of Mst1-TG mice with AAV9-Nfs1 virus, which alleviated ferroptosis, mitochondrial damage and DCM phenotype. In conclusion, in the DCM model with Hippo pathway activation, our findings unravel that NFS1 downregulation occurs and leads to insufficient ISC biosynthesis and cardiomyocyte ferroptosis. Our findings implicate that restoration of cardiomyocyte NFS1 level may represent a new therapeutic strategy for DCM.",Redox Biol,14/03/2025

In addition, prior research is limited by small sample sizes and a failure to account for the competitive effects of other CRM diseases.Methods:In this study, data obtained from the large-scale, prospective UK Biobank cohort were used. CRM multimorbidity was defined as the new-onset of ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease during follow-up. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse the independent association between TyG-BMI and each CRM multimorbidity (first, double, or triple CRM diseases). The C-statistic was calculated for each model, and a restricted cubic spline was applied to assess the dose-response relationship. A multi-state model was used to investigate the association between TyG-BMI and the trajectory of CRM multimorbidity (from baseline [without CRM disease] to the first CRM disease, the first CRM disease to double disease, and double disease to triple disease), with disease-specific analyses.Results:This study included 349,974 participants, with a mean age of 56.05 (standard deviation [SD], 8.08), 55.93% of whom were female. Over a median follow-up of approximately 14 years, 56,659 (16.19%) participants without baseline CRM disease developed at least one CRM disease, including 8451 (14.92%) who progressed to double CRM disease and 789 (9.34%) who further developed triple CRM disease. In the crude model, each SD increase in TyG-BMI was associated with a 47% higher risk of the first CRM disease, a 72% higher risk of double CRM disease, and a 95% higher risk of triple CRM disease, with C-statistics of 0.625, 0.694, and 0.764, respectively. Multi-state model analysis showed a 32% increased risk of new CRM disease, a 24% increased risk of progression to double CRM disease, and a 23% increased risk of further progression for those with double CRM diseases. TyG-BMI was significantly associated with the onset of all individual first CRM diseases (except for stroke) and with the transition to double CRM disease. Significant interactions were also observed, but TyG-BMI remained significantly associated with CRM multimorbidity across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses, including varying time intervals for entering states and an expanded CRM definition (including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and dyslipidaemia), confirmed these findings.Conclusion:TyG-BMI remarkably influences the onset and progression of CRM multimorbidity. Incorporating it into CRM multimorbidity prevention and management could have important public health implications.",Cardiovasc Diabetol,21/03/2025

Mutations in mast cell receptors have been suggested as a potential mechanism underlying CSU. MRGPRX2 has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU. However, the relationship between mutations in MRGPRX2 and their impact on disease severity and receptor function remains poorly understood.Methods:80 CSU patients were included in the study. Peripheral blood was collected for DNA sequencing in the coding exon of MRGPRX2. UAS7 scores and laboratory tests were recorded, serum MRGPRX2 levels were measured by ELISA. RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) MRGPRX2 and mutant variants. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess MRGPRX2 cell surface expression. Functional assays were performed to measure degranulation by β-hexosaminidase release, calcium mobilization, and cytokine synthesis by RT-qPCR. Additionally, phosphorylation of signaling kinases was detected by western blotting.Results:Missense variants of MRGPRX2 185A>G (n=8, 10%) and 185A>G+46A>C co-mutations (n=23, 28.75%) were identified in CSU patients. Patients carrying 185A>G mutation had significantly higher UAS7 scores, lower circulating basophil and lymphocyte counts than those with WT MRGPRX2. The 185A>G mutation but not 185A>G+46A>C was associated with increased MRGPRX2 expression in both CSU patients and RBL-2H3 cells expressing the 185A>G mutation. Cells transfected with the 185A>G mutation demonstrated increased mast cell degranulation, calcium mobilization, cytokine synthesis, and ERK phosphorylation upon MRGPRX2 activation, whereas the 46A>C+185A>G co-mutation did not show these changes.Conclusions:The 185A>G mutation in MRGPRX2 contributes to a gain-of-function phenotype that is associated with enhanced disease activity in CSU patients.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,18/03/2025

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is shown to predict the prognosis of breast cancer, but its utility in eTNBC remains unclear. 130 stage II-III female eTNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have been enrolled prospectively and subjected to ctDNA analysis. ctDNA at post-NAC (pre-surgery) and post-surgery, but not at baseline, is associated with worse prognosis. A threshold of 1.1% maximum variant allele frequency at baseline stratifies patients with different relapse risk, which is validated internally and externally. A systemic tumor burden model integrating baseline and post-surgery ctDNA is independently prognostic (p = 0.022). Combining systemic tumor burden with pathologic response identifies a highly curable subgroup and a subgroup of high-risk eTNBC patients. ctDNA surveillance during follow-up identifies patients with high relapse risk. In conclusion, systemic ctDNA analysis demonstrates the utility of a systemic tumor burden model of ctDNA in risk stratification of eTNBC patients, which may guide future treatment escalation or de-escalation trials.",Nat Commun,21/03/2025

This list was used to create preferences surveys in which experts were presented with pairwise comparisons of clinical vignettes and asked to select the case that was more likely to represent ASSD. Experts' answers were analysed using the Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives method to determine the weights of the key variables to formulate the MCDA-based classification criteria. Clinical vignettes scored by the experts as consensus cases or controls and real-world data collected in participating centres were used to test the performance of candidate classification criteria using receiver operating characteristic curves and diagnostic accuracy metrics.Results:Positivity for antisynthetase antibodies had the highest weight for ASSD classification. The highest-ranked clinical manifestation was ILD, followed by myositis, mechanic's hands, joint involvement, inflammatory rashes, Raynaud phenomenon, fever, and pulmonary hypertension. The candidate classification criteria achieved high areas under the curve when applied to the consensus cases and controls and real-world patient data.

However, its role with spinal anesthesia and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of subanesthetic dosing of ketamine during TKA on postoperative pain and narcotic consumption.Methods:In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, we enrolled 91 patients undergoing primary TKA with spinal anesthesia in a single institution from 2017 to 2018. Patients were randomized to receive intraoperative ketamine infusion at a rate of 6 mcg/kg/min for 75 minutes or a saline placebo. All patients received spinal anesthesia and otherwise identical surgical approaches, pain management, and rehabilitation protocols. Patient-reported visual analog pain scores were calculated preoperatively, postoperative days (POD) 0-7, and 2 weeks. Narcotic consumption was evaluated on POD 0 and 1.Results:There was no difference in average pain between ketamine and placebo at all time points except for at PODs 1 (45 vs 56, P = .041) and 4 (39 vs 49, P = .040). For least pain experienced, patients administered with ketamine experienced a reduction in pain only at POD 4 (22 vs 35, P = .011). There was no difference in maximum pain cohorts at all time points of the study or in-hospital morphine equivalents between the 2 cohorts.Conclusion:As part of multimodal pain management protocol, intraoperative ketamine does not result in a clinically significant improvement in pain and narcotic consumption following TKA.",J Arthroplasty,00/00/0000
10.1186/s13075-025-03530-x,CRP-Albumin-Lymphocyte index (CALLYI) as a risk-predicting biomarker in association with osteoarthritis,"Maosen Geng, Ke Zhang","Purpose:As a novel biomarker, the C-reactive protein-Albumin-Lymphocyte Index (CALLYI) offers a comprehensive evaluation of the human body from three perspectives. However, the association between CALLYI and the incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) remains unclear. This cross-sectional study investigates the potential relationship between CALLYI and OA in US adults, develops a clinical prediction model, and validates its effectiveness.Method:The study cohort consisted of 18,624 U.S. adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2010. The CALLYI was calculated using the formula: albumin * lymphocytes / CRP * 10. Three weighted multiple regression models were constructed to investigate the correlation between CALLYI and OA. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to evaluate the nonlinear relationship between these two variables. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine interactions. Univariate logistic regression, binary logistic regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were utilized for variable selection in the prediction model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were applied to assess the predictive performance of the models.Results:The total sample size analyzed in this study was 18,624, of which 1,977 (10.62%) were diagnosed with OA. And the mean value of CALLYI was 5.13 (2.12,12.86). The multivariate logistic regression model revealed a negative correlation between elevated CALLYI and OA. The fully adjusted Model 3 demonstrated a significant 28% reduction in OA risk in the Q4 compared to the Q1 of CALLYI (OR = 0.72 95% CI: 0.59-0.88, p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses did not reveal any significant interactions (p > 0.05). Additionally, a significant non-linear relationship between CALLYI and OA using RCS (p < 0.0001). After variable screening, we constructed an OA prediction model incorporating CALLYI, and the results were visualized using a nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.825 (95% CI: 0.817-0.834), and DCA indicated that the model holds clinical significance.Conclusion:This study, utilizing NHANES statistics, is the first to establish a nonlinear negative relationship between CALLYI and OA, with no significant interaction observed in subgroup analyses. In the OA prediction model incorporating CALLYI, we validated the effectiveness and clinical utility of this model, providing evidence that CALLYI can serve as a biomarker for OA risk prediction. Nevertheless, larger multicenter prospective cohort studies are necessary to mitigate the limitations inherent in cross-sectional designs and self-reported OA diagnoses.",Arthritis Res Ther,19/03/2025

Apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) has emerged as a novel target for lowering triglycerides. Multiple clinical trials of small-interfering RNA therapeutics targeting APOC3 are currently underway.Objective:To investigate whether genetically predicted lower APOC3 is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk and if the combined exposure to APOC3 and LDL-C-lowering variants is associated with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).Design, setting, and participants:This was a population-based genetic association study with 2 × 2 factorial mendelian randomization. Included were participants of European ancestry in the UK Biobank. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to July 2024.Exposures:Genetic scores were constructed to mimic the effects of APOC3, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.Main outcomes and measures:Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, CHD, and type 2 diabetes (T2D).Results:This study included 401 548 UK Biobank participants (mean [SD] age, 56.9 [8.0] years; 216 901 female [54.0%]). Genetically predicted lower APOC3 was associated with a lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98) and T2D (0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Genetically lower APOC3 and PCSK9 were associated with a similar magnitude of risk reduction in CHD per 10-mg/dL decrease in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) level (APOC3: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83; PCSK9: 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77). Combined exposure to genetically lower APOC3 and PCSK9 was associated with an additive lower risk of CHD (APOC3: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; PCSK9: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97; combined: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93). Genetically lower HMGCR was also associated with a lower risk of CHD, and the risk was further reduced when combined with APOC3 (0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).Conclusions and relevance:Genetically predicted lower APOC3 was associated with a reduced risk of CHD that is comparable with that associated with lower PCSK9 per unit decrease in ApoB. Combined exposure to APOC3 and LDL-C-lowering variants was associated with an additive reduction in CHD risk. Future studies are warranted to investigate the therapeutic potential of these combined therapies, particularly among high-risk patients who cannot achieve therapeutic targets with existing lipid-lowering therapies.",JAMA Cardiol,19/03/2025

Anhedonia is a common symptom of depression for which ketamine is highly efficacious, but the underlying circuits and synaptic changes are not well understood. Here, we show that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is essential for ketamine's effect in rescuing anhedonia in mice subjected to chronic stress. Specifically, a single exposure to ketamine rescues stress-induced decreased strength of excitatory synapses on NAc-D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs). Using a cell-specific pharmacology method, we establish the necessity of this synaptic restoration for the sustained therapeutic effects of ketamine on anhedonia. Examining causal sufficiency, artificially increasing excitatory synaptic strength onto D1-MSNs recapitulates the behavioral amelioration induced by ketamine. Finally, we used opto- and chemogenetic approaches to determine the presynaptic origin of the relevant synapses, implicating monosynaptic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus.",Neuron,18/03/2025

These structures protect the phage from nucleases and may create selective pressure for immunity mechanisms targeting this specific phage family. Here, we identify ""jumbo phage killer"" (Juk), a two-component immune system that terminates infection of ϕKZ-like phages, suppressing the expression of early phage genes and preventing phage DNA replication and phage nucleus assembly while saving the cell. JukA (formerly YaaW) rapidly senses the EPI vesicle by binding to an early-expressed phage protein, gp241, and then directly recruits JukB. The JukB effector structurally resembles a pore-forming toxin and destabilizes the EPI vesicle. Functional anti-ϕKZ JukA homologs are found across bacterial phyla, associated with diverse effectors.

These DAMPs, along with hemoglobin and cell corpses, trigger localized inflammation. Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) plays a crucial role in efferocytosis by acting as a ""don't eat-me"" signal, modulating inflammation and tissue homeostasis. However, the precise function and regulatory mechanisms of SIRPα in efferocytosis remain unclear. Proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals that SIRPα levels are significantly elevated in the CSF of SAH patients and correlate with clinical outcomes. In vivo and in vitro studies show that microglial knockdown of SIRPα promotes efferocytosis and attenuates neuroinflammation following SAH. SIRPα inhibits efferocytosis by recruiting and phosphorylating SHP1 and SHP2 through phosphorylation of four tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain, with SHP1 playing a particularly critical role. Mutation of these tyrosine residues to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues enhances efferocytosis and reduces neuroinflammation in vitro. RNA-seq analysis suggests that this mutation upregulates the expression of ""eat-me"" signals, MerTK and CD36, and identifies STAT6 as a key transcription factor involved in this process. In conclusion, SIRPα plays a central role in regulating microglia efferocytosis and neuroinflammation after SAH via the SHP1/STAT6 axis. Targeting this pathway may provide a promising therapeutic approach for SAH.",J Neuroinflammation,19/03/2025

This study aimed to determine whether the polygenic risk score for AF might be useful in the risk stratification of AF-related cardiovascular events.Methods and results:This study included 9597 oral anticoagulation-naive patients with AF with a CHA2DS2-VA (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age ≥75 years; diabetes; prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism; vascular disease; and age 65-74 years) score of 0 or 1 from the UK Biobank. Patients were stratified according to polygenic risk score tertiles and observed for the occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization. The risks of incident events associated with the polygenic risk score were investigated using inverse probability of treatment weighting.

Data were from the genome wide association studies (GWASs) database to estimate causal relationships between diet data and periodontitis. Two-sample MR analyses were conducted by using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method.Results:The MR showed alcohol consumption and sugars intake increased the risk of chronic periodontitis with odds ratio (OR) 2.768 (95% CI: 1.03e + 00-7.42e + 00) and 2.123 (95% CI: 1.06e + 00-4.26e + 00) respectively. Vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and folate, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D and zinc, were not causally associated with chronic periodontitis. Alcohol consumption greater than 2.5 drinks per day and sugar intake more than 4.88 g increased the risk of periodontitis, with a calculated relative risk of 1.33 and 1.61, respectively.Conclusion:It is suggested to drink alcohol less than 2.5 drinks/day and consume sugar less than 4.88 g/day to avoid alcohol and sugar consumption promoting the development of periodontitis.

This has raised concerns that TNF-α inhibitor use may be associated with an increased risk of HZ. However, the risk profiles for newer biologics, including IL-17 inhibitor (IL-17i), IL-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) and IL-23 inhibitor (IL-23i), remain uncertain.Objective:To compare HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) risks among different biologics, including ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, etanercept and adalimumab, with traditional systemic treatments (TST).Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD 2011-2021). We included patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis aged 20 years and above who had been treated with biologics or TST for at least six months. We classified patients by individual biologics or TST and followed them up for 2.5 years from drug initiation until the occurrence of outcome events or death. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of HZ. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for covariates, including patient age, sex, comorbidities and co-medications. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the risk of HZ among different biologics.Results:In total, we identified 815, 1870, 1095, 2327, 261, 303 and 98 patients with psoriasis receiving etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab and guselkumab, respectively. Compared to patients receiving TST, for those receiving ustekinumab and guselkumab the risk of HZ trended lower (weighted HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.61-1.11; 0.48, 0.22-1.02), while for those receiving adalimumab it was statistically significantly higher (weighted HR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.22-2.18). Additionally, ustekinumab was associated with a reduced risk of PHN (HR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.64). There were no significant differences in the risk of HZ between TST and either etanercept, secukinumab, ixekizumab or brodalumab.Conclusions:The findings suggested ustekinumab and guselkumab may be associated with a reduced risk of HZ and PHN, compared to TST.

When and whether a second agent, such as vasopressin, should be added is unknown.Objective:To derive and validate a reinforcement learning model to determine the optimal initiation rule for vasopressin in adult, critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine for septic shock.Design, setting, and participants:Reinforcement learning was used to generate the optimal rule for vasopressin initiation to improve short-term and hospital outcomes, using electronic health record data from 3608 patients who met the Sepsis-3 shock criteria at 5 California hospitals from 2012 to 2023. The rule was evaluated in 628 patients from the California dataset and 3 external datasets comprising 10 217 patients from 227 US hospitals, using weighted importance sampling and pooled logistic regression with inverse probability weighting.Exposures:Clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables grouped hourly for 120 hours in the electronic health record.Main outcome and measure:The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.Results:The derivation cohort (n = 3608) included 2075 men (57%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (56-70) years and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at shock onset of 5 (3-7 [range, 0-24, with higher scores associated with greater mortality]). The validation cohorts (n = 10 217) were 56% male (n = 5743) with a median (IQR) age of 67 (57-75) years and a SOFA score of 6 (4-9). In validation data, the model suggested vasopressin initiation in more patients (87% vs 31%), earlier relative to shock onset (median [IQR], 4 [1-8] vs 5 [1-14] hours), and at lower norepinephrine doses (median [IQR], 0.20 [0.08-0.45] vs 0.37 [0.17-0.69] µg/kg/min) compared with clinicians' actions. The rule was associated with a larger expected reward in validation data compared with clinician actions (weighted importance sampling difference, 31 [95% CI, 15-52]). The adjusted odds of hospital mortality were lower if vasopressin initiation was similar to the rule compared with different (odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]), a finding consistent across external validation sets.Conclusions and relevance:In adult patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine, the use of vasopressin was variable. A reinforcement learning model developed and validated in several observational datasets recommended more frequent and earlier use of vasopressin than average care patterns and was associated with reduced mortality.",JAMA,18/03/2025

In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization for declaring the potential causal association between LSBs and these diseases and summarized the causal estimates.Methods:In this study, we used GWAS summary statistics from the public database for exposures (LSB: television watching, computer use, and driving) and outcomes (chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and related complications). To ensure reliable results for this study, we applied several methods including IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median for the regression process; MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, 'leave-one-out' analysis and MR-PRESSO test were used to detect horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity for sensitivity analysis.Results:Television watching was harmful of CKD (OR = 1.26, 95%CI 1.09-1.44;p= 0.0011), T2D (OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.48-2.24;p= 1.67e - 08) and DM (OR = 2.26, 95%CI 1.75-2.93;p= 6.44e - 10). No horizontal pleiotropy was detected in MR-Egger intercept test (pvalue > 0.05) and there were no influential SNPs based on 'leave-one-out' analysis.Conclusions:Mendelian randomization estimates in our study genetically predicted the causal effect between television watching and CKD, T2D, and DM. However, we cannot get the definitive causal effect of television watching and other related complications, further studies need to be done to explore the mechanism of action of sedentary behavior on the complications of diabetes and chronic kidney disease.",Ren Fail,00/00/0000
10.1073/pnas.2420534122,Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation facilitates HSPC development via maintenance of genomic stability in zebrafish,"Xiaohan Wang, Mengyao Liu, Yifan Zhang, Dongyuan Ma, Lu Wang, Feng Liu","During fetal stage, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo rapid proliferation with a tight control of genomic stability. Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation has been reported to stabilize the genome in proliferating cells, its specific role in HSPC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein 5 (Wdr5)-mediated H3K4 methylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability of proliferating HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. Loss ofwdr5led to a severe reduction of HSPC pool in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, accompanied with attenuated H3K4 methylation level and evidentp53-dependent apoptosis in the HSPCs. Mechanistically, Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation maintains genomic stability by inhibiting the formation of abnormal R-loops in the HSPCs, whereas accumulation of R-loops exacerbates DNA damage. Moreover, the absence of H3K4 trimethylation leads to an inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is deleterious to DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Subsequently, we found that DDR-associated genes,mutL homolog 1andbreast and ovarian cancer interacting helicase 1, are important to ensure HSPC survival, likely by stabilizing their genome. In summary, these findings reveal that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for HSPC development through tight control of R-loop accumulation and DDR-associated program to ensure genomic stability and survival of proliferating HSPCs.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,25/03/2025

Multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics, enable depicting the complexity of the gut microbial ecosystem. However, these tools generate a large data stream, which integration is needed to produce clinically useful readouts but, in turn, might be difficult to carry out with conventional statistical methods. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been increasingly applied to multi-omics datasets in several conditions associated with microbiome disruption, from chronic disorders to cancer. Such tools show potential for clinical implementation, including the discovery of microbial biomarkers for disease classification or prediction, the prediction of response to specific treatments, the fine-tuning of microbiome-modulating therapies.

Risk factors for cachexia, including tumour characteristics and nutritional parameters, were examined to develop diagnostic scales using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:Ten nutrition items (body mass index, weight loss, intake reduction, physical activity function, fatigue, handgrip strength, anorexia, albumin level, albumin/globulin ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) with different weighted scores were identified to construct a nutrition-weighted scoring scale (NWSS) for nutrition risk. Tumour type and tumour burden status (tumour-node-metastasis stage and radical or non-radical tumour) were determined to construct a disease-weighted scoring scale (DWSS) for disease risk. A lumped scale (5 × 5 matrix) established using a five-grade classification of nutrition and disease risk was used to determine a five-grade classification of comprehensive cachexia risk: A, no cachexia risk (reference; lowest disease and nutrition risks); B, cachexia risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.517 [4.033/5.058]); C, pre-cachexia (HR = 9.755 [8.73/10.901], medium survival = 21.21 months); D, cachexia (HR = 16.901 [14.995/19.049], medium survival = 11.61 months); and E, refractory cachexia (HR = 31.879 [28.244/35.981], medium survival = 4.83 months, highest disease and nutrition risks) (p < 0.001). Patients in Categories A-D benefited from nutrition therapy and anti-tumour treatments to varying degrees. Patients in Category E were clinically refractory to nutrition therapy without prolonged survival compared with patients without nutrition therapy (medium survival, pre-hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. without nutrition therapy, 2.89 [1.91/3.88] vs. 4.04 [3.21/4.88] vs. 5.89 [4.73/7.04] months, p = 0.015) and anti-tumour treatments without prolonged survival compared with patients receiving palliative care (medium survival, radical anti-tumour treatments vs. adjuvant anti-tumour treatments vs. palliative anti-tumour treatments vs. and palliative care, 6.48 [4.42/8.53] vs. 6.48 [3.23/9.73] vs. 4.83 [4.22/5.44] vs. 2.70 [1.09/4.30] months, p = 0.263).Conclusion:We systematically developed a novel definition and grading diagnostic criteria for tumour-type-specific comprehensive cancer cachexia risk.",J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,00/00/0000

The aim of this study, the largest to date, was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, usage patterns, and patient characteristics of FOS in a real-world setting.Methods:Interim analysis of an ongoing, prospective, non-interventional, multicentre study in five European countries, involving centres in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Austria.Results:A total of 716 patients were enrolled between January 2017 and November 2023 (mean age: 62.8 years, APACHE II: 18.3, SOFA: 6.7). Main indications for FOS were bacteraemia/sepsis (23.6%), complicated urinary tract infections (18.0%), and bone and joint infections (17.4%). Other indications included hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (11.0%), complicated skin and soft tissue infections (9.1%), bacterial meningitis/central nervous system (CNS) infections (7.8%), and infective endocarditis (6.4%). Most common pathogens identified were Staphylococcus aureus (31.4%, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae) (17.2%), Escherichia coli (14.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.9%), other Enterobacterales (10.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.4%). In 34.6% of patients, an MDR pathogen was involved. Carbapenem resistance (CR) was high in Klebsiella spp. infections (59/123, 48.0%). In most patients, FOS was used in combination therapy (90.2%). The median dose was 15 g/day. Overall, clinical success and clinical response were favourable with 75.3% and 83.4% at the end of FOS treatment. Clinical success rates in infections caused by MDR or CR pathogens were 78.0% and 81.8%, respectively. Microbiological cure was achieved in 82.4% of all patients. Electrolyte imbalances were the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions, while gastrointestinal disorders were rare.Conclusion:The results from this study suggest that FOS is a safe and effective option as combination partner in the treatment of patients with severe infections caused by both GP and GN pathogens, including deep-seated infections and/or involvement of MDR bacteria.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier,NCT02979951.",Infect Dis Ther,19/03/2025

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicatingDrosophilasalivary gland andBombyxsilk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",Sci Adv,21/03/2025

The function of transmembrane protein 176B (TMEM176B) in the progression of OC remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of TMEM176B on OC proliferation and metastasis.Method:Expression of TMEM176B in OC and normal tissues were determined from the TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC databases, and verified by patient-derived tissue samples. We analysed the prognostic relevance of TMEM176B in OC via Kaplan‒Meier (K‒M) survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Subsequent in vitro assays, including the CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay, were performed to detect the influence of TMEM176B on cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, a tumorigenesis study in nude mice was conducted to confirm the suppressive impact of TMEM176B on OC. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to uncover the mechanisms of TMEM176B on OC progression. Spearman correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlations between TMEM176B and cell adhesion, DNA replication, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Finally, the role of TMEM176B in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) depending on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was evaluated using LiCl agonist.Result:The mRNA expression of TMEM176B was significantly downregulated in OC tissues, with lower TMEM176B correlating with a worse prognosis. Moreover, higher tumor stage and tumor grade were associated with a lower TMEM176B protein level. Consistent with these findings, OC tissues exhibited significantly reduced of TMEM176B compared to normal ovarian tissue from patients. In vitro studies indicated that TMEM176B knockdown increased both the proliferation, metastasis and EMT levels of OC cells, while TMEM176B overexpression had the opposite effects. In vivo investigations reinforced that TMEM176B significantly inhibited the progression of OC. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that TMEM176B enhanced cell adhesion, diminished DNA replication, and suppressed EMT through the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, effectively obstructing the proliferation and metastasis of OC cells and impeding the disease's progression.Conclusions:TMEM176B inhibited EMT in OC cells by controlling the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This mechanism underscored the diagnostic and prognostic potential of TMEM176B for OC and highlights its tumor-suppressive properties as a promising therapeutic candidate.",J Transl Med,19/03/2025

Functionally, silencing LINC02776 reduces proliferation and DNA damage repair in OC cells, thereby enhancing sensitivity to platinum and PARPi in both xenograft mouse models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models with acquired chemoresistance. Mechanistically, LINC02776 binds to the catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), promoting PARP1-dependent polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and facilitating homologous recombination (HR) restoration. Additionally, high HIF-1α expression in platinum-resistant tissues further stimulates LINC02776 transcription.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that targeting LINC02776 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for OC patients who have developed resistance to platinum or PARPi.Key points:LINC02776 promotes OC cell proliferation by regulating DNA damage and apoptosis signaling pathways. LINC02776 binds PARP1 to promote DNA damage-triggered PARylation in OC cells. LINC02776 mediates cisplatin and olaparib resistance in OC cells by enhancing PARP1-mediated PARylation activity and regulating the PARP1-mediated HR pathway. The high expression of LINC02776 is induced by HIF-1α in platinum-resistant OC cells and tissues.",Clin Transl Med,00/00/0000

This complex environment of antagonism and synergy involves both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, whose collaborative metabolic pathways and immunomodulatory elements influence system homeostasis. As with the gut and other niches, the oral microbiome has the capacity to affect distal host sites. The ability to manipulate this environment holds the potential to impact local and systemic disease.With the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, novel approaches to reduce the burden of disease are essential. The use of probiotics and prebiotics is one such strategy. Probiotics introduce non-pathogenic bacteria into the environment to compete with pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites, or to produce metabolites that counteract disease aetiologies. Prebiotic compounds enhance the growth of health-associated organisms, offering additional benefits, whilst a conjunctive approach with probiotics potentially holds even greater promise. Though widely studied in the gastrointestinal context, their potential for treating oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontitis, is less understood. Additionally, the use of microbial transplantations has demonstrated efficacy in other areas, reducing systemic inflammation and recolonising with commensal bacteria. Here we evaluate their use in the oral context and their modulatory impact on overall health.In this chapter, we discuss how pro- and prebiotic strategies seek to modulate both the oral and gut environments to promote oral health and prevent disease. We assess novel approaches for utilising health-associated microorganisms to combat oral disorders, either administered locally in the mouth or imparting influence through immune modulation via the oral-gut axis. By examining available clinical trial data, we aim to further understand the intricacies involved in this discipline. Furthermore, we consider the challenges facing the research community, including optimal candidate organism/compound selection and colonisation retention, as well as considerations for future research.",Adv Exp Med Biol,00/00/0000

It is reasonable to think that some of these features could result from a hypothalamic dysfunction affecting the centre regulating sleep, metabolism and the autonomic nervous system.Aim:The study presents the evidence available to date that suggests the involvement of a hypothalamic disorder in Huntington's disease.Development:Histopathological, hormonal and neuroimaging research relates this area of the brain to Huntington's disease. The experimental findings and those obtained with animal models or in studies conducted with patients are summarised. Likewise, the clinical repercussions (sleep and circadian rhythm disorders, psychiatric and cognitive pathologies, and the clinical signs and symptoms linked to autonomic dysfunction) secondary to possible involvement of the hypothalamus in this disease are also described.Conclusions:The hypothalamus acts as a centre that integrates the neuroendocrine and autonomic functions, and plays a significant role in cognitive and behavioural signs and symptoms. Disorders of this type have been highlighted in Huntington's disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role and scope of this region of the brain in this disease.",Rev Neurol,01/11/2017

Despite the pivotal roles of cellular metabolism, a comprehensive elucidation of metabolomic heterogeneity in cells and its connection with cellular oxidative and senescent status remains elusive. By integrating single-cell live imaging with mass spectrometry (SCLIMS), we establish a cross-modality technique capturing both metabolome and oxidative level in individual cells. The SCLIMS demonstrates substantial metabolomic heterogeneity among cells with diverse oxidative levels. Furthermore, the single-cell metabolome predicted heterogeneous states of cells. Remarkably, the pre-existing metabolomic heterogeneity determines the divergent cellular fate upon oxidative insult. Supplementation of key metabolites screened by SCLIMS resulted in a reduction in cellular oxidative levels and an extension of C. elegans lifespan. Altogether, SCLIMS represents a potent tool for integrative metabolomics and phenotypic profiling at the single-cell level, offering innovative approaches to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in cellular processes.",Nat Commun,20/03/2025

Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population5. As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided6. Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts7, when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection8-13. Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2low'G0-like' phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection.",Nature,19/03/2025

Reducing inappropriate and excessive use of extended-spectrum antibiotics is essential for treating CAP effectively. Evaluating the risk of drug-resistant pathogens (DRPs) is crucial for determining initial antibiotic therapy in clinical settings.Methods:This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the risk factors for DRPs in patients with CAP. CAP-DRPs were defined as pathogens resistant to commonly used antibiotics for CAP, including nonpseudomonal β-lactams such as ceftriaxone or sulbactam-ampicillin, macrolides and respiratory fluoroquinolones. The studies included were divided into two cohorts, namely an all-patient cohort, comprising both culture-positive and culture-negative patients, and a culture-positive pneumonia cohort, comprising patients with identified causative pathogens. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for CAP-DRPs in the all-patient cohort.Results:24 articles were included with 11 categorised into the all-patient cohort. The meta-analysis identified 11 significant risk factors for CAP-DRPs, namely prior DRP infection/colonisation, tracheostomy, severe respiratory failure requiring early induction of mechanical ventilation, prior use of antibiotics, chronic lung disease, COPD, wound care, neurological disorders, prior hospitalisation, nursing home residence and low activities of daily living.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on CAP-DRP. Unlike previous reviews, the all-patient and culture-positive pneumonia cohorts were analysed separately. Findings from the all-patient cohort are particularly relevant for guiding initial antimicrobial selection in clinical practice.

This review summarizes key developments in imaging modalities, computational tools, and clinical applications, highlighting major breakthroughs in thoracic diseases-lung cancer, pulmonary nodules, interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COVID-19 pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism-and outlining future directions.Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven computer-aided detection systems and radiomic analyses have notably improved the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules, while photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) and low-field MRI offer enhanced resolution or radiation-free strategies. For lung cancer, CT texture analysis and perfusion imaging refine prognostication and therapy planning. ILD assessment benefits from automated diagnostic tools and innovative imaging techniques, such as PCD-CT and functional MRI, which reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures while improving accuracy. In COPD, dual-energy CT-based ventilation/perfusion assessment and dark-field radiography enable earlier detection and staging of emphysema, complemented by deep learning approaches for improved quantification. COVID-19 research has underscored the clinical utility of chest CT, radiographs, and AI-based algorithms for rapid triage, disease severity evaluation, and follow-up. Furthermore, tuberculosis remains a significant global health concern, highlighting the importance of AI-assisted chest radiography for early detection and management. Meanwhile, advances in CT pulmonary angiography, including dual-energy reconstructions, allow more sensitive detection of pulmonary emboli.Collectively, these innovations demonstrate the power of merging novel imaging technologies, quantitative functional analysis, and AI-driven tools to transform thoracic disease management.

This prospective study analyzed ruxolitinib dosing patterns and associated clinical outcomes in patients with MF over 12 months.Methods:ROMEI, a multicenter, observational, ongoing study, enrolled 508 adult patients with MF treated with ruxolitinib. For the current interim analysis, eligible patients with baseline platelet values were categorized into two groups based on ruxolitinib starting dosage: as expected (AsEx, n = 174) and lower than expected (LtEx, n = 132); ruxolitinib dose changes, interruptions and time to permanent discontinuation were analyzed, along with symptoms response, health-related QOL scores, spleen response, OS, and safety.Results:Forty-three percent of patients started at a lower-than-expected dose. Both groups showed reduction in average daily ruxolitinib doses over 12 months. Symptoms response rate was similar in both groups at week 48 (40.8% AsEx vs 40.9% LtEx). The AsEx group demonstrated higher spleen response rates at both 24 weeks (50.0% vs 30.2%) and 48 weeks (57.7% vs 45.8%) with a shorter median time to first response (3.3 vs 11.1 months, p = .019) when compared to the LtEx group.

Lactylation is a post-translational modification induced by lactate that regulates gene expression. However, whether lactylation affects the chemoresistance of CCSCs remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that histone lactylation enhances CCSC chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our findings showed that p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, whereas HDAC1 facilitates its delactylation in CCSCs. Notably, lactylation at H4K12 (H4K12la) upregulates GCLC expression and inhibits ferroptosis in CCSCs, and the inhibition of p300 or LDHA decreases H4K12la levels, thereby increasing the chemosensitivity of CCSCs. Additionally, the GCLC inhibitor BSO promotes ferroptosis and sensitizes CCSCs to oxaliplatin. Taken together, these findings suggest that histone lactylation upregulates GCLC to inhibit ferroptosis signaling, thus enhancing CCSC chemoresistance. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between cellular metabolism and chemoresistance and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting p300, LDHA, and GCLC. We showed that histones H4K12 lactylation promoted chemoresistance in CSCs. p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, HDAC1 inhibits the histone lactylation at the same site. H4K12la in CSCs regulates the expression of the ferroptosis-related gene GCLC, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and leading to chemoresistance.

However, intervention-associated adverse effects may impede patients' motivation to participate in dietary/exercise interventions. We examined the effects of time restricted eating (TRE) with or without resistance training (RT) on body composition, mood profile, and sleep quality in young college adults with overweight or obesity.Methods:Fifty-four young college students with overweight/obesity were randomized into control (CON), TRE, RT, and TRE plus RT (TRE+RT) trials. The TRE trials restricted to an eating window of 10-hour/day for 8-week. The RT trials performed supervised resistance exercise, while the control trial maintained a regular lifestyle. Changes in body composition variables, blood pressure, mood status, and sleep quality were measured before and after the intervention.Results:TRE intervention alone or in combination with RT significantly (p< 0.01) decreased body weight (>2 kg) and BMI (~1 kg/m2) in adults with overweight/obesity. Both RT alone and combined with TRE substantially decreased fat mass by 1.1 ± 0.5 and 3.2 ± 0.4 kg, respectively. The decreased fat mass was greater in the combination trial than in the RT trial, whereas TRE alone had no effect. In contrast, fat-free mass was significantly (p< 0.01) decreased with TRE (-2.3 ± 06 kg), increased with RT (1.6 ± 0.3 kg), and was stably maintained with combination interventions. The reduced waist and hip circumferences in the TRE (p< 0.01) were similar to those in the TRE+RT trials, however, RT alone had no effect. Time and group interaction showed a large effect size (partial eta squared) for all body composition variables. In addition, RT with or without TRE notably decreased diastolic blood pressure (RT: -5.5 ± 1.9 mmHg, TRE+RT: -4.1 ± 1.5 mmHg,p< 0.05). Mild anxiety levels at baseline in RT (4.8 ± 2.6) and TRE+RT (4.1 ± 3) trials were found to be normal at postintervention in TRE+RT (3.6 ± 1.7) but not in RT (5.6 ± 3.5). No depression or stress was recorded among the participants during the intervention. The reported poor sleep quality among participants at baseline was significantly improved with RT (4.8 ± 2.9;p< 0.05), and tended to improve with TRE+RT interventions (4.5 ± 1.9).Conclusions:10-hour TRE is beneficial for weight/fat loss without affecting mood status. However, TRE combined with RT might be more effective for weight/fat loss, maintaining muscle mass, and good quality of sleep among young adults with overweight or obesity.",J Int Soc Sports Nutr,00/00/0000

Information quality was evaluated using the DISCERN score, and readability was assessed through Flesch-Kincaid indices.Results:DeepSeek-R1 produced the most readable responses, with Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) scores ranging from 7.2 to 9.0, succeeded by ChatGPT-4o. In contrast, ChatGPT-o3 exhibited the lowest readability (FKGL > 10.4). The DISCERN scores for all AI models were below 60, classifying the information quality as ""fair,"" primarily due to insufficient cited references.Conclusion:All models achieved merely a ""fair"" quality rating, underscoring the necessity for improvements in citation practices, and personalization. Nonetheless, DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT-4o generated more readable surgical information than ChatGPT-o3. Given that enhanced readability can improve patient engagement, reduce anxiety, and contribute to better surgical outcomes, these two models should be prioritized for assisting patients in the clinical.Limitation & future direction:This study is limited by the rapid evolution of AI models, its exclusive focus on spinal surgery education, and the absence of real-world patient feedback, which may affect the generalizability and long-term applicability of the findings. Future research ought to explore interactive, multimodal approaches and incorporate patient feedback to ensure that AI-generated health information is accurate, accessible, and facilitates informed healthcare decisions.",Int J Med Inform,13/03/2025

However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells.

Patients initiating tirzepatide treatment were compared with those undergoing BMS. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and major adverse kidney events (MAKEs). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and stratified analyses were performed based on age, sex and BMI categories.Results:After exclusions and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 84 884 matched pairs were analysed. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.19 per 100 person-years in the tirzepatide group compared with 0.57 in the BMS group. Tirzepatide was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with BMS (HR, 0.311; 95% CI, 0.257-0.375; p < 0.0001). The mortality benefits were consistent across age groups, genders and BMI categories. Tirzepatide also reduced the risk of MACEs (HR, 0.743; 95% CI, 0.673-0.821; p < 0.0001) and MAKEs (HR, 0.375; 95% CI, 0.336-0.419; p < 0.0001). Stratified analyses demonstrated significant reductions in primary and secondary outcomes across most categories.Conclusion:Tirzepatide demonstrated superior clinical outcomes compared with BMS in adults with obesity, including significant reductions in all-cause mortality, MACEs and MAKEs. These findings suggest that tirzepatide may serve as an effective non-surgical alternative to BMS, with broad applicability across diverse patient populations.",Diabetes Obes Metab,20/03/2025

Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach.Results:A total of 301 trials (377 comparisons) provided data on 56 different treatments or treatment combinations. One treatment for acute low back pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), and five treatments for chronic low back pain (exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonists) were efficacious; effect sizes were small and of moderate certainty. Three treatments for acute low back pain (exercise, glucocorticoid injections, paracetamol), and two treatments for chronic low back pain (antibiotics, anaesthetics) were not efficacious and are unlikely to be suitable treatment options; moderate certainty evidence. Evidence is inconclusive for remaining treatments due to small samples, imprecision, or low and very low certainty evidence.Conclusions:The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo. The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain due to the limited number of randomised participants and poor study quality. Further high-quality, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to address the remaining uncertainty in treatment efficacy along with greater consideration for placebo-control design of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments.Trial registration number:OSF Registries; https://osf.io/2dk9z.",BMJ Evid Based Med,18/03/2025

As a new treatment method that has changed the existing treatment paradigm, there has been a short time from its emergence to FDA approval. However, with the increasing number of cases and the passage of time, hidden problems have gradually been exposed. In this review, we summarize the short- and long-term toxicity, such as secondary T-cell tumors and lethal CAR tumors, of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CD19-CAR-T cells, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), ICANS, and secondary malignancies with low occurrence rates but high mortality, such as secondary T cell tumors and lethal CAR tumors, which may be related to the gene modification mechanism of viral vectors currently approved for CAR-T cells.

Preclinical studies suggest that αSyn can exacerbate tau aggregation, implying that αSyn co-pathology may specifically contribute to the Aβ-induced aggregation of tau that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. To investigate this, we combined a novel CSF-based seed-amplification assay (SAA) to determine αSyn positivity with amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging in a large cohort ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with dementia, examining whether αSyn co-pathology accelerates Aβ-driven tau accumulation and cognitive decline.Methods:In 284 Aβ-positive and 308 Aβ-negative subjects, we employed amyloid-PET, Flortaucipir tau-PET, and a CSF-based αSyn seed-amplification assay (SAA) to detect in vivo αSyn aggregation. CSF p-tau181measures were available for 384 subjects to assess earliest tau abnormalities. A subset of 155 Aβ-positive and 135 Aβ-negative subjects underwent longitudinal tau-PET over approximately 2.5 years. Using linear regression models, we analyzed whether αSyn SAA positivity was linked to stronger Aβ-related increases in baseline fluid and PET tau biomarkers, faster Aβ-driven tau-PET increase, and more rapid cognitive decline.Results:αSyn SAA positivity was more common in Aβ + vs. Aβ- subjects and increased with clinical severity (p < 0.001). Most importantly, αSyn positivity was also associated with greater amyloid-associated CSF p-tau181increases (p = 0.005) and higher tau-PET levels in AD-typical brain regions (p = 0.006). Longitudinal analyses confirmed further that αSyn positivity was associated with faster amyloid-related tau accumulation (p = 0.029) and accelerated amyloid-related cognitive decline, potentially driven driven by stronger tau pathology.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that αSyn co-pathology, detectable via CSF-based SAAs, is more prevalent in advanced AD and contributes to the development of aggregated tau pathology thereby driving faster cognitive decline. This highlights that a-Syn co-pathology may specifically accelerate amyloid-driven tau pathophysiology in AD, underscoring the need to consider αSyn in AD research and treatment strategies.",Mol Neurodegener,18/03/2025

However, whether hepatic fat loss occurs continuously with fibrosis progression is controversial. We proposed a ""burning-out"" concept to describe this process and analyze the long-term outcomes of ""burnt-out"" and ""burning-out"" MASLD.Methods:We included a MASLD cohort from 16 centers, including 3273 individuals with baseline histology and 5455 with serial vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) measurements during the follow-up. ""Burnt-out"" MASLD was defined by steatosis grade ≤ S1 and fibrosis stage ≥ F3. Trajectory analysis identified ""burning-out"" patients with continuous trends of decreasing controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and increasing liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values.Results:Of 3273 patients with histological evaluation included, 435 had ""burnt-out"" MASLD. Compared to those with pronounced steatosis in advanced fibrosis, patients with ""burnt-out"" had higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.02), liver-related events (LREs) (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.78), and hepatic decompensation (HR, 1.83, 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.01). Of 5455 patients with VCTEs included for trajectory analysis, 176 were identified as ""burning-out"" MASLD. The incidence rates of all-cause mortality, LREs, and decompensation were 7.28, 26.47, and 21.92 per 1000 person-years in ""burning-out"" patients, respectively. The ""burning-out"" group had higher cumulative incidences of adverse outcomes than patients with consistently high CAP and moderate/low LSM values (P <0.0001).Conclusion:Continuous hepatic fat loss accompanied by fibrosis progression, referred to as ""burning-out"", was observed in advanced MASLD and associated with high rates of all-cause mortality, LREs and hepatic decompensation.",Gastroenterology,18/03/2025

Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, integrated with spatial analyses, revealed that GBMs, but not low-grade gliomas, exhibit significant alterations in the tumor vasculature, including the emergence of diverse pathological vascular cell subtypes. However, these alterations are less pronounced in GBMs than in BrMs. Notably, the BrM vasculature shows higher permeability and more extensive interactions with distinct immune cell populations.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), originally developed to treat diabetes, now provide substantial efficacy in the treatment of obesity. However, concerns of risk of suicidality with these medicines have been raised.Objective:To evaluate the risk of suicidality and self-harm in randomized, placebo-controlled trials of GLP-1 RAs in adults with diabetes or obesity.Data sources:MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to August 29, 2023.Study selection:Reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) lasting 6 or more months comparing GLP-1 RAs with placebo for the treatment of diabetes or obesity published in peer-reviewed journals were identified. Two independent reviewers screened all search-identified studies for inclusion. Records of outcomes were queried from primary papers, ClinicalTrials.gov entries, and corresponding authors.Data extraction and synthesis:Two independent researchers abstracted data and assessed data quality and validity using PRISMA guidelines. Data were pooled using random-effects models.Main outcomes and measures:Pooled incidence of completed or attempted suicide, occurrences of suicidal ideation, or self-harm.Results:A total of 27 of 144 RCTs meeting inclusion criteria systematically recorded suicide and/or self-harm-related events and included 32 357 individuals receiving GLP-1 RAs and 27 046 treated with placebo, over 74 740 and 68 095 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Event incidence was very low in the GLP-1 RA (0.044 per 100 person-years) and placebo (0.040 per 100 person-years) groups, with no statistically significant difference (rate ratio [RR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.48-1.21; P = .24). Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in outcomes based on diabetes status or GLP-1 RA used. Five studies were considered at risk of bias due to the loss of more than 5% of participants to follow-up. Otherwise, studies were not found to be heterogeneous nor at high risk of bias.Conclusions and relevance:There is unlikely to be an increase in the very low incidence of suicide-related adverse events among individuals receiving GLP-1 RAs within the context of RCTs. While these findings may further ease concerns about these adverse effects, continued monitoring is warranted to identify particular patients who may be at risk as extended use of GLP-1 RAs expands.",JAMA Psychiatry,19/03/2025

A trend toward an increased DFS event rate after completion of 3 years adjuvant treatment in ADAURA suggests that some patients may benefit from longer adjuvant osimertinib treatment. We therefore explored whether tumor-informed, circulating tumor DNA-based, molecular residual disease (MRD) could predict recurrence in an exploratory post hoc analysis of 220 patients (n = 112 osimertinib; n = 108 placebo) from ADAURA. MRD preceded imaging DFS events in this study by a median of 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.6) months. DFS and MRD event-free rate at 36 months was 86% versus 36% for patients in the osimertinib versus placebo groups (hazard ratio, 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.36)). In the osimertinib group, DFS or MRD events were detected in 28 (25%) patients; most events occurred following osimertinib cessation (19 of 28, 68%) and within 12 months of stopping osimertinib (11 of 19, 58%). At 24 months after osimertinib, the DFS and MRD event-free rate was 66%. In this study, MRD preceded DFS events in most patients across both arms. DFS and MRD event-free status was maintained for most patients during adjuvant osimertinib treatment and posttreatment follow-up, with most MRD or DFS events occurring after osimertinib treatment discontinuation or completion.

A protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor, GSK484, was employed to suppress NETs release. To assess changes in hippocampal gene expression induced by GSK484 treatment in CLP mice, we utilized RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, the Elisa, cognitive function test, western bolt and immunofluorescence staining were used to measured hippocampal inflammatory cytokine, cognitive function, and the protein levels of tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) in SAE mice. We also established a Transwell™ co-culture system using bEnd.3 cells and bone marrow-derived neutrophils to examine the effects of GSK484 on endothelial cell function. This comprehensive approach allowed us to evaluate the impact of NETs inhibition on neuroinflammation, cognitive function, and the underlying molecular mechanisms in the CLP-induced SAE model.Results:Our findings revealed that neutrophils were significantly overactivated, releasing abundant NETs in the hippocampus of CLP-induced SAE mice. Inhibition of NET formation using GSK484 led to reduced neuroinflammatory responses, improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and enhanced survival rates and cognitive function in SAE mice. RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analyses identified the Wnt signaling pathway as the most significant pathway affected. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that NETs inhibition alleviated BBB damage primarily by increasing the expression of Occludin, a TJs protein, and promoting the formation of the VCL/β-catenin/VE-cadherin complex at AJs, mediated by the Wnt3/β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway.Conclusions:Our results suggest that inhibition of NETs may protect BBB permeability and cognitive function through the Wnt3/β-catenin/TCF4 signaling pathway in the context of CLP-induced SAE, which provides a promising strategy for SAE therapy.",J Neuroinflammation,18/03/2025

It differs from late-onset gastric cancer (LOGC) in clinical and molecular characteristics. The current strategies for EOGC detection have certain limitations in diagnostic performance due to the rising trend in EOGC.Objective:We developed a liquid biopsy signature for EOGC detection.Design:We use a systematic discovery approach by analysing genome-wide transcriptomic profiling data from EOGC (n=43), LOGC (n=31) and age-matched non-disease controls (n=37) tissue samples. An extracellular vesicle-derived long non-coding RNA (EV-lncRNA) signature was identified in blood samples from a training cohort (n=299), and subsequently confirmed by qPCR in two external validation cohorts (n=462 and n=438), a preoperative/postoperative cohort (n=66) and a gastrointestinal tumour cohort (n=225).Results:A three EV-lncRNA (NALT1, PTENP1 and HOTTIP) liquid biopsy signature was developed for EOGC detection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.924 (95% CI 0.889 to 0.953). This EV-lncRNA signature provided robust diagnostic performance in two external validation cohorts (Xi'an cohort: AUROC, 0.911; Beijing cohort: AUROC, 0.9323). Furthermore, the EV-lncRNA signature reliably identified resectable stage EOGC patients (stage I/II) and demonstrated better diagnostic performance than traditional GC-related biomarkers in distinguishing early-stage EOGC (stage I) from precancerous lesions. The low levels of this biomarker in postsurgery and other gastrointestinal tumour plasma samples indicated its GC specificity.Conclusions:The newly developed EV-lncRNA signature effectively identified EOGC patients at a resectable stage with enhanced precision, thereby improving the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.",Gut,20/03/2025

However, the development of TKI resistance and the subsequent transition from the chronic phase (CP) to blast crisis (BC) threaten patients with CML. Accumulating evidence suggests that translational control is crucial for cancer progression. Our high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screening identified poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) as a driver for CML progression in the BC stage. PABPC1 preferentially improved the translation efficiency of multiple leukaemogenic mRNAs with long and highly structured 5' untranslated regions by forming biomolecular condensates. Inhibiting PABPC1 significantly suppressed CML cell proliferation and attenuated disease progression, with minimal effects on normal haematopoiesis. Moreover, we identified two PABPC1 inhibitors that inhibited BC progression and overcame TKI resistance in murine and human CML. Overall, our work identifies PABPC1 as a selective translation enhancing factor in CML-BC, with its genetic or pharmacological inhibition overcoming TKI resistance and suppressed BC progression.",Nat Cell Biol,18/03/2025

However, the persistence of cancer cells with low levels or complete absence of the target antigen, thereby evading detection by CAR T cells, leads to relapse.

We introduce a synthetic chimeric T cell receptor (ChTCR) that confers superior antigen sensitivity compared with CARS and previous hybrid TCR designs and is readily adapted for bispecific targeting. ChTCRs replicate the structure of natural TCRs, form classical immune synapses and demonstrate TCR-like signaling. T cells expressing bispecific ChTCRs (Bi-ChTCRs) are more effective than bispecific CAR T cells in eradicating tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression in vivo in female mice. The Bi-ChTCR architecture is resilient and can be designed to target pairs of B cell and multiple myeloma antigens.

By contrast with hospital-acquired MRSA, community-acquired MRSA is more susceptible to non b-lactam antibiotics. We investigated the high virulence potential of certain strains of this bacterium.Methods:We ascertained the whole genome sequence of MW2, a strain of community-acquired MRSA, by shotgun cloning and sequencing. MW2 caused fatal septicaemia and septic arthritis in a 16-month-old girl in North Dakota, USA, in 1998. The genome of this strain was compared with those of hospital-acquired MRSA strains, including N315 and Mu50.Findings:Meticillin resistance gene (mecA) in MW2 was carried by a novel allelic form (type IVa) of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), by contrast with type II in N315 and Mu50. Type IVa SCCmec did not carry any of the multiple antibiotic resistance genes reported in type II SCCmec. By contrast, 19 additional virulence genes were recorded in the MW2 genome. All but two of these virulence genes were noted in four of the seven genomic islands of MW2.Interpretation:MW2 carried a range of virulence and resistance genes that was distinct from those displayed on the chromosomes of extant S aureus strains. Most genes were carried by specific allelic forms of genomic islands in the MW2 chromosome. The combination of allelic forms of genomic islands is the genetic basis that determines the pathogenicity of medically important phenotypes of S aureus, including those of community-acquired MRSA strains.",Lancet,25/05/2002

The inflammatory response triggered by gut microbiota may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the impact of gut microbiota on emotional state, known as the ""Gut-mood"" relationship, could play a role in depression and anxiety disorders.Results:This review summarizes recent data on the role of gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, brain cancer, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder and stroke. Also, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study on seven neurological disorders (Epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, brain cancer, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder and stroke). MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests confirmed the robustness of analysis against horizontal pleiotropy.Conclusions:By comparing the protective and risk factors for neurological disorders found in our research and other researches, we can furtherly determine valuable indicators for disease evolution tracking and potential treatment targets. Future research should explore extensive microbiome genome-wide association study datasets using metagenomics sequencing techniques to deepen our understanding of connections and causality between neurological disorders.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,06/03/2025

However, post-procedural gastro-oesophageal reflux was more common after POEM at 2 years. Here we report 5-year follow-up data.Methods:This study is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial performed at eight centres in six European countries (Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium). Patients with symptomatic primary achalasia were eligible for inclusion if they were older than 18 years and had an Eckardt symptom score higher than 3. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; randomly permuted blocks of sizes 4, 8, or 12) to undergo either POEM or LHM plus Dor fundoplication. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined by an Eckardt symptom score of 3 or less without the use of additional treatments, at 2 years, and was reported previously. Prespecified secondary endpoints at 5 years were clinical success; Eckardt symptom score; Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score; lower oesophageal sphincter function by high-resolution manometry; and parameters of post-procedural reflux (reflux oesophagitis according to the Los Angeles classification; pH-metry, and DeMeester clinical score). We hypothesised that POEM would be non-inferior (with a non-inferiority margin of -12·5 percentage points) to LHM plus Dor fundoplication with regards to clinical success. All analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all patients who underwent the assigned procedure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01601678) and is complete.Findings:Between Dec 7, 2012, and Oct 9, 2015, 241 patients were randomly assigned (120 to POEM and 121 to LHM) and 221 had the assigned treatment (112 POEM and 109 LHM; mITT). 5-year follow up data were available for 90 (80%) patients in the POEM group and 87 (80%) patients in the LHM group. Clinical success rate at 5 years was 75·0% (95% CI 66·2 to 82·1) after POEM and 70·8% (61·7 to 78·5) after LHM (difference 4·2 percentage points [95% CI -7·4 to 15·7]). The mean Eckardt symptom score decreased from baseline to 5 years in both groups and the overall difference in mean scores was -0·29 (95% CI -0·62 to 0·05). Change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index scores, as well as in integrated relaxation pressure on manometry, from baseline to 5 years, did not differ significantly between the groups. At 5 years, 26 (41%) of 63 patients after POEM and 18 (31%) of 58 patients after LHM had reflux oesophagitis (difference 10·2 percentage points [95% CI -7·0 to 26·8]). Significant oesophagitis (Los Angeles classification grade B, C, or D) was observed in nine (14%) of 63 patients after POEM and in four (7%) of 58 patients after LHM. pH-metry was performed in 81 (37%) of 221 patients, with higher mean acid exposure time for POEM (10·2% [95% CI 7·6 to 14·2]) than for LHM (5·5% [3·1 to 11·8]). Significantly more patients in the POEM than in the LHM group had abnormal acid exposure time at 5 years (>4·5%; 28 [62%] of 45 vs 11 [31%] of 36; difference 31·7 percentage points [95% CI 9·8 to 50·5]). The presence of reflux symptoms at 5 years was similar in both groups, with a mean DeMeester clinical score of 1·3 (95% CI 1·0 to 1·6) after POEM and 1·1 (0·9 to 1·4) after LHM. The complications of peptic stricture, Barrett's oesophagus, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma were not reported.Interpretation:Our long-term results support the role of POEM as a less invasive myotomy approach that is non-inferior to LHM in controlling symptoms of achalasia. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was common in both groups, but with a tendency towards higher rates in the POEM group. Thus, patients should be provided with the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in decision making.Funding:European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network, Hamburgische Stiftung für Wissenschaften, Entwicklung und Kultur Helmut und Hannelore Greve, Dr med Carl-August Skröder Stiftung, Dr Gerhard Büchtemann Stiftung, Agnes-Graefe Stiftung, Georg und Jürgen Rickertsen Stiftung, Reinhard Frank Stiftung, Johann Max Böttcher Stiftung, Richard und Annemarie Wolf Stiftung, Olympus Europa, German Society for Gastroenterology and Metabolism and Olympus Europe Foundation, United European Gastroenterology Week, Olympus EuroNOTES Research Fund Program, Harvard Catalyst, the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center, and Harvard University and its affiliated academic health-care centres.",Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,17/03/2025

Here we examined TUS-induced changes in the basal ganglia of 10 individuals with movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and dystonia) and 15 healthy participants. Local field potentials were recorded using deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Compared to sham, theta burst TUS (tbTUS) increased theta power during stimulation, while 10 Hz TUS enhanced beta power, with effects lasting up to 40 min. In healthy participants, a stop-signal task assessed tbTUS effects on the GPi, with pulvinar stimulation serving as an active sham. GPi TUS prolonged stop-signal reaction times, indicating impaired response inhibition, whereas pulvinar TUS had no effect. These findings provide direct electrophysiological evidence of TUS target engagement and specificity in deep brain structures, suggesting its potential as a noninvasive DBS strategy for neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Nat Commun,19/03/2025

It remains to be uncovered whether there is spatial control of m6A deposition on different types of RNAs. Here, through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in the A549 cell line, we find that H3K27ac acetylase p300-mediated METTL3 acetylation suppresses the binding of METTL3 on H3K27ac-marked chromatin by inhibiting its interaction with METTL14. Consistently, p300 catalyzing the acetylation of METTL3 specifically occurs on H3K27ac-marked chromatin. Disruptive mutations on METTL3 acetylation sites selectively promote the m6A of chromatin-associated RNAs from p300-bound enhancers and promoters marked by H3K27ac, resulting in transcription inhibition of ferroptosis-inhibition-related genes. In addition, PAK2 promotes METTL3 acetylation by phosphorylating METTL3. Inhibition of PAK2 promotes ferroptosis in a manner that depends on the acetylation of METTL3. Our study reveals a spatial-selective way to specifically regulate the deposition of m6A on enhancer and promoter RNAs.",Mol Cell,11/03/2025

To address this, we develop metabolically reprogrammed CAR (MCAR) T cells with enhanced autophagy and mitophagy. A compound screening identifies a synergy between GLP-1R agonist (semaglutide [SG]) and Urolithin A (UrA), which activate autophagy through mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibition and mitophagy via Atg4b activation, maintaining mitochondrial metabolism in CAR T cells (MCAR T-1). These changes increase CD8+T memory cells (Tm), enhancing persistence and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in xenograft models. GLP-1R knockdown in CAR T cells diminishes autophagy/mitophagy induction, confirming its critical role. We further engineer GLP-1-secreting cells (MCAR T-2), which exhibited sustained memory, stemness, and long-term persistence, even under tumor re-challenge. MCAR T-2 cells also reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risks while demonstrating potent anti-tumor effects. This strategy highlights the potential of metabolic reprogramming via targeting autophagy/mitophagy pathways to improve CAR T cell therapy outcomes, ensuring durability and efficacy.",Cell Rep Med,18/03/2025

Nevertheless, the regulatory role of lactate in immune sensing of cytosolic DNA remains uncertain. Here, we report that lactate serves as an initiator to facilitate proteasomal degradation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) independent of ubiquitin, thus repressing the production of interferon and contributing to tumor growth. Mechanistically, lactylation of K21 stimulates cGAS translocation from the nucleus to the proteasome for degradation, which is compromised by phosphorylation of PSMA4 S188 via disrupting its association with cGAS. Concurrently, lactylation of K415 rewires PIK3CB activity and impairs ULK1-driven phosphorylation of PSMA4 S188. Physiologically, lactylation of cGAS sustains tumor growth. Expression of cGAS correlates with the antitumor effect of the LDHA inhibitor FX11. Finally, the lactate-cGAS axis indicates a prognostic outcome of lung adenocarcinoma. Collectively, these findings not only put forth a mechanism of cGAS degradation but also unravel the clinical relevance of cGAS lactylation.",Cell Rep,18/03/2025

However, the molecular mechanisms behind primate skeletal muscle ageing remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that SIRT5 expression is reduced in aged primate skeletal muscles from both genders. SIRT5 deficiency in human myotubes hastens cellular senescence and intensifies inflammation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TBK1 is a natural substrate for SIRT5. SIRT5 desuccinylates TBK1 at lysine 137, which leads to TBK1 dephosphorylation and the suppression of the downstream inflammatory pathway. Using SIRT5 lentiviral vectors for skeletal muscle gene therapy in male mice enhances physical performance and alleviates age-related muscle dysfunction. This study sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of skeletal muscle ageing and presents the SIRT5-TBK1 pathway as a promising target for combating age-related skeletal muscle degeneration.",Nat Metab,14/03/2025

This study aimed to develop a predictive model for delirium in this patient population and identify associated risk factors.Methods:Data for the machine learning model were obtained from the MIMIC-IV database. Feature variable screening was conducted using Lasso regression and the best subset method. Four models-K-nearest neighbor, random forest, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were trained and optimized to predict delirium risk. The stability of the model is evaluated using ten-fold cross validation and the effectiveness of the model on the validation set is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to explain the importance of each variable in the model.Results:A total of 1,155 patients admitted to the intensive care unit between 2008 and 2019 were included in the study, with a delirium incidence of 12.9% (149/1,155). Among the four ML models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best discriminative ability. In the validation set, it achieved an AUC of 0.932, indicating superior performance with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.891, 0.839, 0.795, and 0.810, respectively. Key features identified through SHAP analysis included the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) verbal score, length of hospital stay, mean SpO₂ on the first day of ICU admission, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation score, mean diastolic blood pressure, GCS motor score, gender, and duration of noninvasive ventilation. These findings provide valuable insights for individualized risk management.Conclusions:The developed prediction model effectively predicts the occurrence of delirium in elderly COPD patients with respiratory failure in the ICU.

However, the precise mechanisms by which fibroblasts contribute to IPF pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The study reveals that Sema3E and its receptor Plexin D1 are significantly overexpressed in the lungs of IPF patients and bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrotic mice. Elevated plasma levels of Sema3E in IPF patients are negatively correlated with lung function. Importantly, Sema3E in IPF lungs predominantly exists as the P61-Sema3E. The knockdown of Sema3E or Plexin D1 effectively inhibits fibroblast activation, proliferation, and migration. Mechanistically, Furin-mediated cleavage of P87-Sema3E into P61-Sema3E drives these pro-fibrotic activities, with P61-Sema3E-PlexinD1 axis promoting fibroblast activation, proliferation, and migration by affecting the phosphorylation of ErbB2, which subsequently activates the ErbB2 pathways. Additionally, Furin inhibition reduces fibroblast activity by decreasing P61-Sema3E production. In vivo, both whole-lung Sema3E knockdown and fibroblast-specific Sema3E knockout confer protection against BLM-induced lung fibrosis. These findings underscore the crucial role of the P61-Sema3E-Plexin D1 axis in IPF pathogenesis and suggest that targeting this pathway may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IPF treatment.",Adv Sci (Weinh),20/03/2025

While the exact cause remains unclear, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications. The authors' main objective is to review imaging features of various autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related diseases, and drug-induced autoimmune injury. These disorders are chronic inflammatory conditions causing destruction of hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, destruction of the latter potentially leading to cholestasis and associated ductopenia. Complications related to untreated autoimmune disorders include sequelae of chronic liver failure or cirrhosis, such as portal hypertension and ascites. Neoplasms arising in the setting of cirrhosis related to autoimmune diseases include hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. As these autoimmune disorders of the liver and biliary tract characteristically involve bile ducts and cause cholestasis, MRI or MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the preferred imaging modality, given its ability to provide excellent anatomic details of the bile ducts and demonstrate changes in the liver parenchyma. Understanding the imaging appearance of each of the autoimmune disorders affecting the liver and biliary tract allows a particular diagnosis to be suggested. Imaging studies often provide the first clues to an autoimmune disorder of the liver and bile ducts, enabling early diagnosis to halt progression and prevent complications. In addition, imaging studies are also useful for monitoring progression of disease, assessing treatment response, and detecting complications during follow-up.©RSNA, 2025.",Radiographics,00/00/0000

Recent work has highlighted genetic drivers of this resilience, or better-than-expected cognitive performance given a level of neuropathology, that allow the aged brain to protect itself from the downstream consequences of amyloid and tau deposition. However, models of resilience have been constrained by reliance on measures of neuropathology, substantially limiting the number of participants available for analysis. We sought to determine if novel approaches using APOE allele status, age, and other demographic variables as a proxy for neuropathology could still effectively quantify resilience and uncover novel genetic drivers associated with better-than-expected cognitive performance while vastly expanding sample size and statistical power. Leveraging 20,513 participants from eight well-characterized cohort studies of aging, we determined the effects of genetic variants on resilience metrics using mixed-effects regressions. The outcome of interest was residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language) and built within two frameworks: ""silver"" models, which obviate the requirement for neuropathological data (n=17,241), and ""gold"" models, which include post-mortem neuropathological assessments (n=3,272). We then performed cross-ancestry genome wide association studies (European ancestry n=18,269, African ancestry n=2,244), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. All analyses were conducted across all participants and repeated when restricted to those with unimpaired cognition at baseline. Despite different modeling approaches, the silver and gold phenotypes were highly correlated (R=0.77-0.88) and displayed comparable performance in quantifying better-than or worse-than-expected cognition, enabling silver-gold meta-analyses. Genetic correlation analyses highlighted associations of resilience with multiple neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular traits (PFDR values < 5.0x10-2). In pathway-level tests, we observed three significant associations with resilience: metabolism of amino acids and derivatives (PFDR=4.1x10-2), negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta production (PFDR=1.9x10-2), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (PFDR=3.9x10-4). Finally, in single-variant analyses, we identified a locus on chromosome 17 approaching genome-wide significance among cognitively unimpaired participants (index single nucleotide polymorphism: rs757022, minor allele frequency = 0.18, β=0.08, P=1.1x10-7). The top variant at this locus (rs757022) was significantly associated with expression of numerous ATP-binding cassette genes in brain. Overall, through validating a novel modeling approach, we demonstrate the utility of silver models of resilience to increase statistical power and participant diversity.",Brain,20/03/2025

Investigated parameters include the length, weight, condition factor, vitellogenin (VTG) induction, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) protein level, histopathological alteration of testis, liver and gill, and reproductive capacity. After 21d exposure, no statistical difference was found among the weights, lengths and condition factors of different treatment groups. In all binary mixture groups, decreased VTG levels were detected compared to EE2-only groups; and the AOX levels were significantly lower than DBP-only treatments while both chemicals can individually induce AOX synthesis. Therefore, EE2 and DBP may act additively on VTG and antagonistically on AOX induction in males. After 45d exposure, delayed gametogenesis was observed for the DBP-only groups, indicated by fewer spermatozoa and more spermatocytes, which was further aggravated with the addition of EE2. The developmental delay of testis partially recovered after a 30d depuration in clean water. Combined exposure also caused liver and gill lesions, which were not alleviated during the 30d depuration, suggesting a nonreversible harmful effect the same as single exposure. Mixed EE2 and DBP were observed to impair the reproductive capability (the fecundity and fertilization rate) of males, while single exposure did not. Co-exposed to 0.020µg/L EE2 and 100µg/L DBP promoted the early hatching of offspring (F1 generation) at 48h post-fertilization (hpf), but the survival rates of the F1 generation were similar in all treatments. Our findings indicate that the effects of mixed EE2 and DBP at environmentally relevant levels can be either antagonistic or additive relying on the specific toxicological endpoints and the respective doses of each chemical.",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,00/00/0000

We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients treated with CAR-T for R/R B-cell lymphoma (n = 228) and MM (n = 18) at Ohio State University from 2016 to 2022, with a minimum of two years of follow-up. The median age was 66 years, and the median number of prior treatments was four. With a median follow-up of 38 months (range 11-66), 21 patients (8.5%) developed a second primary malignancy (SPM), with non-melanoma skin cancer being the most common (52%), followed by hematologic malignancies (33%) and non-skin solid tumors (14%). Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 38% of skin cancers, while myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia were the predominant hematologic malignancies. Solid tumors included bladder, prostate, and breast cancer. The distinct pattern of SPMs suggests potential CAR-T-related risks, warranting vigilant post-treatment surveillance. Further studies are necessary to elucidate underlying mechanism and predictive factors and guide long-term management of SPM risk in CAR-T survivors.",J Hematol Oncol,18/03/2025

However, broadening their clinical utility remains a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen to identify potential targets exhibiting synthetical lethality with PARP inhibitors. Our results show that thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAOK1) plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response by phosphorylating ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7), thereby promoting its enzymatic activity and preventing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RAD51, a crucial protein in the filament formation of HR repair. Notably, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TAOK1, as well as blocking peptide targeting the USP7 phosphorylation site, impaired USP7 function, leading to RAD51 degradation, disruption of HR repair, and increased tumor cell and sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study highlights TAOK1 as a critical regulator of HR repair pathway in human cancer cells and presents a therapeutic strategy overcoming resistance to PARPi inhibitors. These findings support the potential clinical application of combining PARP inhibitors with TAOK1 inhibition or peptide treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,25/03/2025

Participants with lifestyle scores of 4 or 5 had a higher risk of all-cause mortality. Even optimal lifestyle practices did not fully mitigate the heightened mortality risk associated with declining cognitive performance.Discussion:A healthy lifestyle is beneficial but cannot fully offset the impact of cognitive impairment. Therefore, integrating routine cognitive assessments and targeted interventions with healthy lifestyle practices is crucial for effectively reducing mortality risk.Highlights:A nationally representative, 10-year prospective cohort in China was employed to investigate the combined effects of lifestyle behaviors and cognitive function on all-cause, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular mortality. Both healthy lifestyle and better cognitive function were associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Even among individuals practicing optimal lifestyle behaviors, cognitive impairment significantly elevated the risk of all-cause and cerebrovascular mortality. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating routine cognitive assessments and targeted interventions with healthy lifestyle practices aimed at reducing mortality risk in aging populations.",Alzheimers Dement,00/00/0000

However, current diagnostic markers lack the requisite sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to develop and validate serum N-glycomics-based models for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related cirrhosis.Approach and results:This study enrolled a total of 397 patients with CHB-related cirrhosis and HCC for clinical management. N-glycomics profiling was conducted on all participants and clinical data were collected. First, machine learning-based models, HCC-GRF and HCC-GSVM, were established for early screening and diagnosis of HCC using N-glycomics. The AUC values in the validation set were 0.967 (95% CI: 0.930-1.000) and 0.908 (0.840-0.976) for HCC-GRF and HCC-GSVM, respectively, outperforming AFP [0.687 (0.575-0.765)] and PIVKA-II [0.665 (0.507-0.823)]. It also showed superiority in subgroups analysis and external validation. Calibration and decision curve analysis also showed good predictive performance. Additionally, we developed a prognostic model, the prog-G model, based on N-glycans to monitor recurrence in HCC patients after curative treatment. During the follow-up period, it was observed that this model correlated with the clinical condition of the patients and could identify all recurrent HCC cases (n=12) prior to imaging findings, outperforming AFP (n=7) and PIVKA-II (n=9), while also detecting recurrent lesions earlier than imaging.Conclusions:N-glycomics models can effectively predict the occurrence and recurrence of HCC to improving the efficiency of clinical decision-making and promoting the precision treatment of HCC.",Hepatology,21/03/2025

In vitro microbiome bioreactors are increasingly used as model systems to investigate effects on intestinal microbiota and consequently methods for the quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in microbiome model systems are required.Methods:An optimized protocol enables the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) without further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA are separated by liquid chromatography on an amide column and identified and quantified with a targeted tandem mass spectrometry method using a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex).Results:Our method has a limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples of <2 ng/mL for both glyphosate and AMPA. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD is 2 and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. These LODs allow for measurement at exposure-relevant concentrations. Glyphosate levels in a bioreactor model of porcine colon were determined and consequently it was verified whether AMPA was produced by porcine gut microbiota.Conclusions:The method presented here allows quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in complex bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies of the impact of glyphosate and its metabolism on intestinal microbiota. In addition, the extraction protocol is compatible with an untargeted metabolomics analysis, thus allowing one to look for other perturbations caused by glyphosate in the same sample.",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,15/04/2020

In this study, we observed lower Forkhead box protein O3 (FoxO3), a transcription factor associated with cellular oxidative stress, enhanced osteoclastogenesis in osteoporosis (OP). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the human femoral head indicated that FoxO3 is widely expressed in macrophages. Furthermore, Lysm-Cre;FoxO3f/fOVX mice showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and more bone loss than normal OVX mice. Mechanistically, we identified FoxO3 promoter methylation as a crucial factor contributing to decreased FoxO3, thereby influencing osteoclastogenesis and OC function. Intriguingly, we observed that Dnmt3a, highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis, played a pivotal role in regulating the methylation of the FoxO3 promoter. Knockdown of Dnmt3a promoted FoxO3 expression, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and mitigating OP. Interestingly, we observed that Dnmt3a alleviated osteoclastogenesis by suppressing ROS via upregulating FoxO3 rather than inducing the dissociation of RANK and TRAF6. Collectively, this study elucidates the role and mechanism of FoxO3 in osteoclastogenesis and OP, providing a epigenetic target for the treatment of OP.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,25/03/2025

We compared the detection of glycemic excursions with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and capillary glucose testing (CBG) in this population.Methods:In this prospective observational study, insulin-treated adults with T2D on hemodialysis for ≥90 days wore a Dexcom G6-Pro CGM. Participants were instructed to perform CBG up to 4 times daily. We compared differences in glucose metrics and described CGM patterns in relation to dialysis sessions.Results:Among 59 participants (age 57. 7±9years, HbA1c 7.09%), mean glucose measured by CBG and CGM was 165.7 ± 41.8 and 188.9 ± 45.0, with a time-in-range (TIR) of 68%±23 and 51%±26, respectively (p < 0.001). CGM detected that all participants had hyperglycemic episodes of 180mg/dL, with time-above-range (TAR) 180mg/dL of 47.8%±27, and 90% had episodes of >250mg/dL, with TAR >250mg/dL of 20.9%±21.7. CGM detected higher rates of hypoglycemia <70mg/dL, (47% vs. 25%, p=0.005) and <54mg/dL, (25% vs. 12%, p=0.08) than CBG testing. Nocturnal and prolonged hypoglycemia <70mg/dL were only detected by CGM (29% and 12%, respectively). CGM showed a pattern of improved glucose levels on pre-dialysis days, lower glucose levels during hemodialysis, and a rapid rise during the post-dialysis period.Conclusions:In participants with T2D and ESKD on hemodialysis, CGM improved the detection of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events, particularly nocturnal and prolonged episodes.

It explores both direct and indirect factors influencing the incidence of gastric cancer and reveals the interrelationships among these factors.Methods:Data were collected from early cancer screenings conducted at the People's Hospital of Lincang between 2022 and 2023. Initial variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and Sliding Windows Sequential Forward Selection (SWSFS), and the screened variables and demographic characteristics features were used as variables for constructing the Bayesian network (BN) model. Subsequently, the performance of the models was evaluated, and the optimal model was selected for network mapping and Bayesian inference using the best model.Results:The incidence rate of gastric cancer in this region's high-risk population was determined to be 7.09%. The BN model constructed from the set of variables consisting of Lasso's selection variables and demographic characteristics had better performance. A total of 12 variables were incorporated into the BN model to form a network structure consisting of 13 nodes and 18 edges. The model shows that age, gender, ethnicity, current address, upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, acid reflux, vomiting), alcohol consumption, smoking, SGIM gastritis, and family history are important risk factors for gastric cancer development.Conclusion:The Bayesian network model provides an intuitive framework for understanding the direct and indirect factors contributing to the early onset of gastric cancer, elucidating the interrelationships among these factors. Furthermore, the model demonstrates satisfactory predictive performance, which may facilitate the early detection of gastric cancer and enhance the levels of early diagnosis and treatment among high-risk populations.",BMC Gastroenterol,21/03/2025

The factors used to identify a malignant lesion and the best surgical technique are uncertain. In this context, the definition of high-volume center and expert surgeon is under debate. The Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE) developed a nationwide survey to investigate the state-of-the-art of adrenal surgery in Italy. A web-based survey comprising 37 questions was developed and distributed to Italian surgeons involved in adrenal surgery. Two hundred forty-eight answers were analyzed. Consensus was reached among the survey participants regarding local infiltration (83%) and rapid growth of the lesion (81%) as markers of malignancy. Nearly 30% of the participants used MIS in case of malignant adrenal lesions. The lateral (50%) and anterior transperitoneal (44%) approaches were the most common among Italian surgeons. Approximately 40% of participants believe that 20-40 adrenalectomies/year are needed to define an expert surgeon and at least 20 procedures/year to define a high-volume center. Approximately half of participants performed < 10 adrenalectomies/year in centers with a median volume < 10 procedures/year. Based on participant feedback, this survey highlights local infiltration and rapid growth as the most significant markers of malignant adrenal lesions. While open adrenalectomy remains the gold standard for suspected malignant lesions, nearly 30% of the participants practice MIS even in these cases. The lateral and anterior transperitoneal approaches emerge as the most familiar for Italian surgeons. A substantial proportion of Italian patients with adrenal lesions undergo surgery performed by surgeons with an annual case volume < 10 procedures, at centers with a low annual volume of adrenalectomies. Moreover, there is a lack of standardized definitions for 'expert surgeon' and 'high-volume center' in this context.",Updates Surg,17/03/2025

Although androgenetic alopecia is a benign condition, it can have a significant impact on patients' self-esteem, mood and quality of life. There are currently two FDA-approved drugs for androgenetic alopecia; topical minoxidil and finasteride. However, some patients with these two drugs show little improvement in hair loss. Thus, there is an urgent need to clarify the mechanisms involved and treatment methods. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia involves many aspects, among which a genetic factor is most important in determining the individual differences between androgenetic alopecia patients. An abnormal increase in 5-α reductase and androgenetic receptors in hair follicles plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia. Microinflammation of hair follicles, changes in the state of oxidative stress, loss of hair follicle stem cells, and metabolic syndrome are also associated with androgenetic alopecia.

Therefore, the study employed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database to investigate the global burden of CKD from 1990 to 2021.Methods:This study utilized data from the GBD 2021. Join-point regression models were developed for the estimation of the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in the prevalence and mortality rates of CKD. Subsequently, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the trends in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and DALYs rate for CKD across diverse populations between 1990 and 2021. Moreover, the influence of age, gender, and socio-demographic index (SDI) on the burden of CKD among patients from 1990 to 2021 was examined. Furthermore, the projection of the burden of CKD from 2022 to 2032 was also conducted.Results:The AAPC for prevalence and mortality rates across the entire period spanning 1990 to 2021 was 0.92 and 2.66, respectively. A notable increase in the DALYs and DALYs rate for CKD was demonstrated over time, indicating a growing CKD burden on society since 1990. Furthermore, the DALYs rates for CKD were lowest in the 5-9 year age group for both genders, rising thereafter with age. Notably, the DALYs rate for CKD was higher in males than in females. Regions with higher SDI, generally exhibited a lower burden of CKD, while less developed regions, demonstrated the opposite pattern. Additionally, the age-standardized prevalence and mortality rates for CKD would be projected to increase to 8,773.85 and 21.26 per 100,000 individuals, respectively, by 2032.Conclusion:The research indicated a gradual increase in the global prevalence and mortality rates of CKD over time, which might prompt the formulation of more efficient health policies to alleviate its burden.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),05/03/2025

However, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between thigh IMFI and incident knee and hip osteoarthritis.Methods:We conducted a cohort study using UK Biobank data, including participants with baseline IMFI in thigh muscle assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and no history of knee or hip osteoarthritis. A total of 24,224 and 24,221 participants were included in analyses of IMFI of anterior and posterior thigh muscle with knee osteoarthritis, respectively, while 24,767 and 24,764 were included for hip osteoarthritis. Cox Proportional-hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident clinically diagnosed knee or hip osteoarthritis, adjusting for potential confounders.Results:During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 472 participants developed knee osteoarthritis, and 387 developed hip osteoarthritis. IMFI in the anterior thigh was significantly associated with incident knee osteoarthritis, with adjusted HRs of 1.78 (1.19-2.65), 2.00 (1.34-2.99), and 2.34 (1.53-3.59) across the second to fourth quartiles, respectively (P for trend <0.01). Both anterior and posterior thigh IMFI were significantly associated with hip osteoarthritis (both Ps for trend <0.01). Dose-response relationships were observed in restricted spline models. The interaction and subgroup analyses support that the effect of IMFI is independent of body mass index and sex.Conclusions:Elevated thigh IMFI is significantly associated with increased incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis.

We surveyed 43 experts to determine their monitoring practices for children and adults with XLH, including pregnant and lactating women. In the initial evaluation of children and adults with XLH, experts consistently obtain family history, fracture history and history of dental infections. They measure height, weight, blood pressure and conduct DNA analysis of multiple genes including the PHEX gene. For children follow-up, experts arrange follow-up every 3-6 months assessing height, weight, blood pressure and examining for skeletal deformities. Laboratory tests for children include serum phosphorus, corrected total/ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase, renal function, parathyroid hormone and spot morning urine for calcium, creatinine and phosphorus. For adult follow-up, experts assess patients every 6-12-months including a clinical examination for skeletal deformities and joint involvment. The laboratory profile is completed at least once a year. In the presence of bone pain, experts conduct X-rays both in children and adults to evaluate for fractures or joint damage. With respect to nephrocalcinosis, renal ultrasound is suggested on an annual basis or less frequently when monitoring children and adults with XLH. Experts conduct a dental assessment at baseline and then every 6-12 months for all patients with XLH. The findings of the survey inform practice for assessing new patients with XLH, monitoring existing patients and identifying areas for future research.

Using adoptive transfer and radiation chimera models, we found that T cell-derived IL-9 was required for MBC development and function. By contrast, B cells deficient in IL-9 generated functionally normal MBCs that support antibody recall normally. IL-9 induced expression of the transcriptional repressor ZBTB18 in GC memory precursor cells and MBCs. ZBTB18 was dispensable for naive B cell activation and GC formation but required for the development of GC-derived MBCs. ZBTB18 directly repressed the expression of a suite of genes encoding cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases, pro-apoptotic genes Bid and Casp3, and the GC-retaining factor S1pr2. Lack of IL-9-mediated instruction or intrinsic programming by ZBTB18 impaired GC-derived MBC development and antibody recall. Thus, an IL-9-ZBTB18 axis instructs the development of functional B cell memory from GCs.",Immunity,14/03/2025

The plethora of sensory symptoms indicates that gut-innervating neurons might be directly affected by inflammation. However, sequencing studies of neurons in the gastrointestinal tract are hampered by difficulties in purifying neurons, especially during inflammation. Activating a nuclear GFP tag selectively in neurons enabled sort purification of intrinsic and extrinsic neurons of the gastrointestinal tract in models of intestinal inflammation. Using bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we mapped the whole transcriptomic landscape and identified a conserved neuronal response to inflammation, which included the interferon signaling and ferroptosis pathway. Deletion of the interferon receptor 1 in neurons regulated ferroptosis, neuronal loss, and consequently gut-transit time. Collectively, this study offers a resource documenting neuronal adaptation to inflammatory conditions and exposes the interferon and ferroptosis pathways as signaling cascades activated in neurons during inflammation.",Neuron,12/03/2025

However, clinical application is hindered by the need for safe, precise control systems to regulate local therapeutic payload expression and release. Here we developed a near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated PadC-based photoswitch (NETMAP) system based on a chimeric phytochrome-activated diguanylyl cyclase (PadC) and a cyclic diguanylate monophosphate-dependent transcriptional activator (MrkH). The NETMAP-engineered bacteria exhibited antitumor performance in mouse tumor models with different levels of immunogenicity. Specifically, in immunogenic lymphoma tumors, NIR-induced PD-L1 and CTLA-4 nanobodies enhanced the activation of adaptive immunity. In low-immunogenic tumors-including mouse-derived colon cancer models, an orthotopic human breast cancer cell line-derived xenograft model and a colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft model-NIR-induced azurin and cytolysin A predominantly led to tumor inhibition.

Here, we tested the capability of blood markers to detect and discriminate variation in performance across multiple cognitive domains in a cognitively unimpaired sample.Methods:Participants (n = 648, aged 69.9 ± 3.8, 71% female) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and assays for plasma-based biomarkers amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/1-40 by mass spectrometry, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ1-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL).Results:Greater p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory performance (β = -0.11, SE = 0.04, p = .003), and remained so after covarying for NfL. Higher NfL was non-specifically associated with poorer performance across a range of cognitive domains and remained so after covarying for p-tau217.Discussion:Blood-based biomarkers may differentiate non-AD-related versus AD-related cognitive deficits. This characterization will be important for early intervention and disease monitoring for AD.Highlights:There is heterogeneity in the causes of cognitive decline in aging. AD-related blood biomarkers may help characterize these causes. Elevated p-tau217 was exclusively associated with poorer episodic memory. Elevated NfL was associated with poorer cognition in a broad range of domains. Blood biomarkers may help differentiate AD- and non-AD-related cognitive deficits.",Alzheimers Dement,00/00/0000
10.1186/s12889-025-22245-x,Association of dietary health indices with frailty,"Ting He, Yifei Yan, Dongdong Wang, Tingting Peng, Liuyin Jin","Background:The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) assesses dietary quality, and lower scores may be associated with an increased risk of frailty. However, few epidemiological studies have examined the relationship between HEI-2015 and the Frailty Index (FI). This study explores the association between HEI-2015 and FI using data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), analyzing how factors such as gender and age influence this relationship.Methods:TNHANES data (2007-2018) were analyzed using logistic regression models to assess the HEI-2015-frailty association. Frailty diagnosis was based on physical activity, strength, fatigue, weight change, and gait speed, with FI scores ranging from 0 to 1. A threshold of 0.21 classified frailty. The R package ""DALEX"" was used for feature importance analysis to enhance the prediction of frailty. From this analysis, we selected 10 key factors to further improve the accuracy of frailty prediction.Result:Of 14,300 participants, 16.2% (2,322) were classified as frail. Frail participants had lower income, higher BMI, lower physical activity, and lower HEI-2015 scores. Higher HEI-2015 scores were associated with reduced frailty risk (adjusted OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.87, P < 0.01). The negative association was stronger in women, higher-income groups, and those with higher education (P < 0.01). Feature importance analysis showed HEI-2015 was the top predictor of frailty.Conclusion:Higher HEI-2015 scores are linked to lower frailty risk. Promoting healthy eating may prevent frailty, especially in high-risk groups, with education and demographic factors influencing this relationship.",BMC Public Health,19/03/2025

This review explores the immunobiological features which may underlie this differential response.Methods:We conducted a literature review of studies assessing impact of immune context following searches on Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Relevant outcomes include response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Data was extracted from multivariate analysis, univariate analysis or directly from Kaplan-Meier curves. Meta-analyses were performed where three or more studies analysed the same immune factor for the same cancer type. Remaining studies were analysed descriptively.Results:In the adjuvant setting assessment of the immune context does not highlight a group failing to derive benefit for the use of dabrafenib/trametinib after resection of BRAFV600E melanoma Differential gene expression in exceptional responders show enrichment of genes associated with immune activation. BRAFV600E colorectal cancer patients with high cytolytic scores benefit from the addition of MEK inhibition whereas those with low scores fare better without. High PD-L1 expression is predictive of inferior outcomes to EGFR, ALK and G12C tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant patients with high CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 positivity have very poor outcomes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes predicts for efficacy of stromal-poor tumours in HER-2+ breast cancer treated with short-course adjuvant trastuzumab. High immune metagene and single immune gene expression is predictive of benefit for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, but not chemotherapy alone. The addition of pertuzumab or lapatanib appears to be beneficial in those with immune non-enriched microenvironments. High MHCI is negatively and high MHCII positively predictive of outcome with trastuzumab-based therapy.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first review assessing immunological context as biomarker for targeted therapy. The results of this review represent an important resource to aid future translational studies in advancing stratified precision medicine oncology.",Ann Oncol,19/03/2025

This study uses data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to estimate the global burden of prostate cancer from 1990 to 2021.Methods:We analyzed the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of prostate cancer globally from 1990 to 2021. Based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI), we used the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and Age-Period-Cohort model to compare the burden of disease across different age groups and regions with varying levels of development. Finally, we used the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model to predict the trend of changes in the disease burden of prostate cancer by 2040.Results:In 2021, the global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of prostate cancer was 15.37 per 100,000, an increase from 13.69 per 100,000 in 1990. However, the age-standardized mortality rate (5.26 per 100,000) and DALY rate (95.94 per 100,000) decreased significantly compared to 1990. The burden of prostate cancer increased with age, but overall, the burden across all age groups was lower in 2021 than in 1990. The only exception was the incidence rate among individuals under 75 in 2021. High-income regions such as North America and Australia exhibited the highest burden in terms of ASIR, though there has been some reduction in recent years. Conversely, the burden of mortality and DALYs was highest in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa, and the Caribbean, where rates have continued to rise. Correlation analysis between SDI and the EAPC of the disease burden showed a negative correlation between EAPC of prostate cancer mortality and DALYs with SDI. The APC analysis showed that in 2021, the ASIR of prostate cancer in high SDI regions was still significantly higher across all age groups compared to other regions. In regions with middle SDI and above, the age-standardized mortality rate and DALY rate decreased over time or across birth cohorts, with a faster decline in areas with higher SDI. By 2040, it is projected that the global ASIR of prostate cancer will reverse its current trend and increase, while the age-standardized mortality rate and DALY rate will continue to decline, and the counts of incidence, mortality, and DALYs will keep rising.Conclusion:Although the global mortality rate and DALY rate for prostate cancer show a decreasing trend, the number of new cases, deaths, and DALYs continues to rise due to global population growth and the aging population, and the disease burden remains significant. Furthermore, there are substantial geographic disparities in the disease burden of prostate cancer. Therefore, targeted programs should be implemented to strengthen prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment in these specific regions.",World J Surg Oncol,20/03/2025
10.1093/jnci/djaf062,Effects of exercise on inflammation in female survivors of nonmetastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Francesco Bettariga, Dennis R Taaffe, Anita Borsati, Alice Avancini, Sara Pilotto, Stefano G Lazzarini, Pedro Lopez, Luca Maestroni, Umberto Crainich, John P Campbell, Timothy D Clay, Daniel A Galvão, Robert U Newton","Background:Despite advances in breast cancer treatment, recurrence remains common and contributes to higher mortality risk. Among the potential mechanisms, inflammation plays a key role in recurrence by promoting tumor progression. Exercise provides a wide array of health benefits and may reduce inflammation, potentially reducing mortality risk. However, the effects of exercise, including mode (ie, resistance training [RT], aerobic training [AT], and combined RT and AT) and program duration, on inflammatory biomarkers in breast cancer survivors remain to be elucidated.Methods:A systematic search was undertaken in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, SPORTDiscus and CENTRAL in August 2024. Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of exercise on IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CRP were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the magnitude of change.Results:Twenty-two studies were included (n = 968). Exercise induced small to large significant reductions in IL-6 (SMD = -0.85; 95% CI = -1.68 to -0.02; p = .05) and TNF-α (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI = -0.81 to 0.01; p = .05) and a trend for a decrease in CRP. When stratifying by exercise mode, trends toward reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α were observed for combined exercise, whilst changes were not generally affected by exercise program duration.Conclusion:Exercise, especially combined RT and AT, can reduce pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and may be a suitable strategy to reduce inflammation in breast cancer survivors. However, further research is needed to investigate the effects of exercise mode and program duration on markers of inflammation in this survivor group.",J Natl Cancer Inst,20/03/2025

We randomized 52 players from the Norwegian women's 1st and 2nd division to a low-volume (220 reps/side) or high-volume (394 reps/side) group. Both groups performed an 8-week protocol of the Adductor Strengthening Programme and a 10-week maintenance protocol with 1 session/week (16 reps/side/session). We measured isometric hip adductor torque (Nm/kg) in a long-lever squeeze test (at 0° and 15° hip abduction) using the ForceFrame at baseline, weeks 4, 6, 8, and 18. Both groups increased their isometric hip adduction strength over the 8-week period (low-volume 0°: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.07-0.20] Nm/kg, 15°: 0.22 [95% CI: 0.07-0.36] Nm/kg; high-volume 0°: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.04-0.22] Nm/kg, 15°: 0.31 [95% CI: 0.18-0.45] Nm/kg), with no between-group difference in either test position (0°: -0.01 [95% CI: -0.11-0.01] Nm/kg; 15°: 0.10 [95% CI: -0.09-0.29] Nm/kg).

We examined the value of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) to guide proactive treat-to-target optimization in CD.Methods:A randomized controlled trial of patients with small-bowel involved (L1/L3) CD in corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CDAI<150). Patients ingested a VCE at baseline and those with a Lewis inflammatory score (LS)≥350 were designated ' high-risk' and randomized to either treat-to-target treatment optimization or continued standard-care. Treat-to-target was optimized by repeat VCE results every six months. Patients with LS<350 ('low-risk') continued standard-care. The primary outcome was the rate of disease exacerbation (CDAI increase>70points and score>150 or hospitalization/surgery) in high-risk standard-care versus treat-to-target groups at 24 months.Results:Of 118 patients screened, 60 were enrolled. Treatment intensification in high-risk group patients allocated to proactive strategy comprised biologic dose-escalation (n=11/20), starting a biologic (8/20) or swapping biologics (1/20). The primary outcome, clinical flare by 24 months, occurred in 5/20 (25%) of high-risk treat-to-target patients versus 14/20 (70%) of the high-risk standard-care group (OR=0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.57, p=0.006). Mucosal healing was significantly more common among treat-to-target group when determined by a cutoff LS<350 (OR 4.5, 95%CI 1.7-17.4, nominal p-value 0.03), but not by the combined scores of total LS<450 and highest-segment LS<350. Among all patients continuing standard-care (n=40), baseline LS was numerically higher among relapsers versus non-relapsers (450, 225-900 versus 225,135-600, respectively, p=0.07). Of 221 VCE ingested, there was a single (0.4%) temporarily-retained spontaneously resolved event.Conclusion:VCE-guided treat-to-target strategy for patients with CD in remission confers superior clinical outcomes compared with continued standard-care.",Gastroenterology,13/03/2025

The study population was divided into groups according to the continuation and discontinuation of OACs at the landmark period of 12 months after CA. Follow-up data were acquired until December 31, 2023, and the study analysis was conducted from January to April 2024.Exposures:OAC discontinuation.Main outcomes and measures:Primary outcomes were thromboembolic and major bleeding events and all-cause death after 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score-matched analyses were used to adjust baseline characteristics.Results:This study included 1821 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [11.7] years; 1339 men [73.5%]). Overall, 922 patients (50.6%) continued OAC for 12 months, whereas 899 (49.4%) discontinued OAC. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (4.0) years, thromboembolic events, major bleeding events, and death occurred in 43 (2.4%), 41 (2.3%), and 71 (3.9%) patients, respectively. After IPTW adjustment, the OAC discontinuation group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of thromboembolism (incidence rate, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.45-1.35] vs 0.37 [95% CI, 0.22-0.54] per 100 person-years; log-rank P = .04) and a lower incidence of major bleeding (incidence rate, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.19] vs 0.65 [95% CI, 0.43-0.90] per 100 person-years; log-rank P < .001) than in the continuation group. In a subgroup analysis, OAC discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism in patients with asymptomatic AF, left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%, and left atrial diameter of 45 mm or greater. In contrast, OAC discontinuation was beneficial for reducing major bleeding risks in patients with a HAS-BLED score of 2 or greater. These outcomes were similar in the propensity score-matched analysis using 1100 paired matched patients, except for insignificant differences in thromboembolic events. Differences in mortality between the 2 groups were not statistically significant.Conclusions and relevance:In this retrospective cohort study, discontinuation of OACs after successful CA was associated with increased thromboembolic events and decreased bleeding events. The benefits of discontinuing OACs were stratified according to specific characteristics, pending a future prospective randomized study.",JAMA Netw Open,03/03/2025

While most SCLCs respond to frontline therapy, resistance inevitably develops. Identifying phenotypes potentiating chemoresistance and immune evasion is a crucial unmet need. Previous reports have linked upregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery to chemoresistance and immune evasion across cancers. However, it is unknown if SCLCs exhibit distinct DDR phenotypes.Methods:To study SCLC DDR phenotypes, we developed a new DDR gene analysis method and applied it to SCLC clinical samples, in vitro, and in vivo model systems. We then investigated how DDR regulation is associated with SCLC biology, chemotherapy response, and tumor evolution following therapy.Results:Using multi-omic profiling, we demonstrate that SCLC tumors cluster into three DDR phenotypes with unique molecular features. Hallmarks of these DDR clusters include differential expression of DNA repair genes, increased replication stress, and heightened G2/M cell cycle arrest. SCLCs with elevated DDR phenotypes exhibit increased neuroendocrine features and decreased ""inflamed"" biomarkers, both within and across SCLC subtypes. Clinical analyses demonstrated treatment naive DDR status was associated with different responses to frontline chemotherapy. Using longitudinal liquid biopsies, we found that DDR Intermediate and High tumors exhibited subtype switching and coincident emergence of heterogenous phenotypes following frontline treatment.Conclusions:We establish that SCLC can be classified into one of three distinct, clinically relevant DDR clusters. Our data demonstrates that DDR status plays a key role in shaping SCLC phenotypes and may be associated with different chemotherapy responses and patterns of tumor evolution.

We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from LITESPARK-005.Methods:LITESPARK-005 was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled phase 3 trial conducted at 147 hospitals and cancer centres in six regions. Eligible participants were 18 years or older with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma, had a Karnofsky Performance Status score of 70% or higher, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, had disease progression on or after treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (in sequence or in combination), and had received no more than three previous systemic lines of therapy. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using interactive voice-response and web-response systems to receive either belzutifan 120 mg orally once daily or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily.

This trial is ongoing, closed to recruitment, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04195750.Findings:Between March 10, 2020, and Jan 19, 2022, 996 participants were screened for eligibility and 746 participants were randomly assigned to belzutifan (n=374) or everolimus (n=372). The PRO full analysis set population included 366 participants in the belzutifan group and 354 in the everolimus group. Median time from randomisation to the database cutoff date (June 13, 2023) was 25·7 months (IQR 21·7-30·4). Completion rates for FKSI-DRS and QLQ-C30 were higher than 94% at baseline and higher than 55% at week 17 in each group. Change from baseline to week 17 in FKSI-DRS score (difference in least-squares mean between groups 1·5 [95% CI 0·7 to 2·2]) and QLQ-C30 global health status-quality of life (QOL) score (6·4 [3·2 to 9·6]) suggested stability with belzutifan versus worsening with everolimus. Change from baseline to week 17 was similar between groups for QLQ-C30 physical functioning (difference in least-squares mean 2·5 [95% CI -0·6 to 5·5]) and QLQ-C30 role functioning (4·2 [0·1 to 8·4]) subscale scores. Time to deterioration was similar between the belzutifan and everolimus groups for EORTC physical functioning (median 19·3 months [95% CI 11·1 to not reached] in the belzutifan group vs 13·8 months [10·6 to not reached] in the everolimus group; hazard ratio 0·93 [95% CI 0·72 to 1·20]) and role functioning (median 12·0 months [9·2 to not reached] vs 10·2 months [4·7 to 14·4]; 0·88 [0·69 to 1·11]).Interpretation:Belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma was associated with improved disease-specific symptoms and QOL compared with everolimus. Taken together with the efficacy and safety data from LITESPARK-005, belzutifan could offer a clinical benefit without compromising the QOL of patients in this setting.Funding:Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Rahway, NJ, USA.",Lancet Oncol,17/03/2025

However, the exact mechanisms underlying its cardioprotective actions remain unclear. Our study investigates the direct effects of semaglutide on human cardiomyocytes, focusing on calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) handling and its potential to improve myocardial contractility.Methods and results:Human left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from non-failing (NF) hearts, patients with aortic stenosis and a HFpEF-like phenotype (AS), and those with end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Late Na current (INa), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak, and contractility were assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes treated with semaglutide. CaMKII inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide and GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin 9-39 (Ex-9-39) were used to elucidate signalling pathways. Semaglutide reduced late INain AS and HFrEF cardiomyocytes to levels comparable to NF. Additionally, semaglutide decreased diastolic SR Ca leak and improved systolic Ca transients and contractility in AS and HFrEF tissue. These effects were mediated through GLP-1 receptor agonism and were comparable to CaMKII inhibition. In multicellular preparations, semaglutide differentially improved myocardial contractility in AS and HFrEF in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion:Semaglutide directly modulates ion homeostasis in human cardiomyocytes, reducing proarrhythmic diastolic SR Ca leak and enhancing systolic function, which may explain its observed clinical benefits. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide and suggest its potential therapeutic use in HF.",Eur J Heart Fail,19/03/2025

Despite its proven efficacy, challenges persist, including unclear mechanisms of action, resistance in 30%-50% of patients, and significant side effects. This review presents an updated and balanced discussion of the antitumor mechanisms of BCG, focusing on its direct effects on bladder cancer and its interactions with various cell types within the bladder tumor microenvironment. Notably, recent research on the interactions between BCG and the bladder microbiome is also incorporated. We further summarize and analyze the latest preclinical and clinical studies regarding both intrinsic and adaptive resistance to BCG in bladder cancer. Based on the current understanding of BCG's therapeutic principles and resistance mechanisms, we systematically explore strategies to improve BCG-based tumor immunotherapy. These include the development of recombinant BCG, combination therapy with different drugs, optimization of therapeutic regimens and management, and the exploration of new approaches by targeting changes in the bladder microbiota and its metabolites. These measures aim to effectively address the BCG resistance in bladder cancer, reduce its toxicity, and ultimately enhance the clinical anti-tumor efficacy. Bacterial therapy, represented by genetically engineered oncolytic bacteria, has gradually emerged in the field of cancer treatment in recent years. As the only bacterial drug successfully approved for oncology use, BCG has provided decades of clinical experience. By consolidating lessons from BCG's successes and limitations, we hope to provide valuable insights for the development and application of bacterial therapies in cancer treatment.",Clin Microbiol Rev,20/03/2025
10.1186/s12943-025-02294-x,Dual role of interferon-gamma in the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors,"Piotr Wawrzyniak, Mariusz L Hartman","Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine produced mainly by immune cells and can affect cancer cells by modulating the activity of multiple signaling pathways, including the canonical Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) cascade. In melanoma, IFN-γ can exert both anticancer effects associated with cell-cycle arrest and cell death induction and protumorigenic activity related to immune evasion leading to melanoma progression. Notably, IFN-γ plays a crucial role in the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which are currently used in the clinic. As these agents target programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), they are designed to restore the antimelanoma immune response. In this respect, IFN-γ produced by cells in the tumor microenvironment in response to ICIs has a beneficial influence on both immune and melanoma cells by increasing antigen presentation, recruiting additional T-cells to the tumor site, and inducing direct antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in melanoma cells. Therefore, IFN-γ itself and IFN-γ-related gene signatures during the response to ICIs can constitute biomarkers or predictors of the clinical outcome of melanoma patients treated with ICIs. However, owing to its multifaceted roles, IFN-γ can also contribute to developing mechanisms associated with the acquisition of resistance to ICIs. These mechanisms can be associated with either decreased IFN-γ levels in the tumor microenvironment or diminished responsiveness to IFN-γ due to changes in the melanoma phenotypes associated with affected activity of other signaling pathways or genetic alterations e.g., in JAK, which restricts the ability of melanoma cells to respond to IFN-γ. In this respect, the influence of IFN-γ on melanoma-specific regulators of the dynamic plasticity of the cell phenotype, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)/CD271 can affect the clinical efficacy of ICIs. This review comprehensively discusses the role of IFN-γ in the response of melanoma patients to ICIs with respect to its positive influence and role in IFN-γ-related mechanisms of resistance to ICIs as well as the potential use of predictive markers on the basis of IFN-γ levels and signatures of IFN-γ-dependent genes.",Mol Cancer,20/03/2025

Noncanonical peptides (NCPs), derived from noncanonical small open reading frames, represent small biological molecules with important roles in biology. However, the antibacterial activity of NCPs remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered a plant-derived noncanonical antibacterial peptide (NCBP1) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. NCBP1 is composed of 11 amino acid residues with cationic surface potential and favorable safety and stability. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCBP1 displayed antibacterial activity by targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane damage and dysfunction. Notably, NCBP1 showed promising efficacy in mice. Furthermore, NCBP1 effectively inhibited the growth of plant fungal pathogens and enhanced disease resistance in maize.

10.1002/mus.28377,"Myofascial Pain Syndrome: An Update on Clinical Characteristics, Etiopathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment","Jeremy P Steen, Kishore S Jaiswal, Dinesh Kumbhare","Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic regional pain condition characterized by trigger points-hyperirritable spots within taut bands of muscle fibers that cause both localized and referred pain. The pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and classification of MPS are still under investigation, which complicates the development of standardized treatment protocols. Although diagnostic tools have improved, MPS often remains underrecognized due to symptom overlap with other pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and joint disorders. Factors contributing to its onset and persistence include muscle overuse, postural imbalance, systemic conditions, and psychological and behavioral influences. This narrative review explores the primary risk factors, current hypotheses on pathogenesis, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and both conventional and emerging treatments. Sufficient evidence supports the use of local anesthetic injections for MPS. Some evidence suggests that dry needling, acupuncture, magnetic stimulation, ultrasound therapy, laser therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and manual therapy may be effective, particularly compared to sham or placebo. However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, botulinum toxin, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation show insufficient evidence, while the effectiveness of muscle relaxants, antidepressants, gabapentin, opioids, topical lidocaine, capsaicin, EMLA cream, and kinesio taping remains inconclusive. Effective management of MPS requires a patient-centered approach that integrates empirically supported and evidence-based treatments tailored to individual needs. This review synthesizes the current understanding of MPS and highlights the need for high-quality research to improve clinical decision-making in managing this complex condition.",Muscle Nerve,20/03/2025

Embelin (EB), a natural para-benzoquinone compound derived from the Embelia ribes Burm.f. has several pharmacological properties.Objective:This research examines how EB influences the inflammatory milieu of the liver in ALD.Methods:In vivo, we created an ALD model by subjecting mice to the Lieber-DeCarli diet for ten days, supplemented by a solitary binge, and subsequent ATF6 silencing. We employed RNA sequencing to analyze the ALD-related signaling pathways. In vitro experiments involved treating AML12 with EB and ethanol, and administering a siRNA-ATF6 to HepG2 cells. We investigated the ATF6 and P2 × 7r promoter interaction through a dual-luciferase assay. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were also treated with lipopolysaccharide/adenosine triphosphate (LPS/ATP) and EB to produce a conditioned medium.Results:EB effectively mitigated lipid synthesis and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during ALD. RNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in the ATF6/NOD-like receptor pathway in alcohol-induced mice. EB up-regulated ATF6 while down-regulating P2 × 7r-NLRP3 and its target genes. shRNA-mediated ATF6 knockdown markedly increased P2 × 7r protein and mRNA levels in mouse livers and exacerbated lipid accumulation. The absence of ATF6 in hepatocytes impaired the inhibitory effect of EB on the P2 × 7r-NLRP3 pathway. It was demonstrated that ATF6 directly binds to the P2 × 7r promoter. Moreover, EB reduced pyroptosis in BMDMs, thereby diminishing the inflammatory response.Conclusions:These findings suggest that EB ameliorates alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) by modulating the ATF6-P2 × 7r/NLRP3 signaling pathway in ALD. EB might be a prospective therapeutic candidate, and its mechanism would be a new direction or strategy for alcoholic liver disease.",Phytomedicine,00/00/0000

We compared the clinical outcomes of these patients receiving EVT with those receiving medical management (MM).Methods:The CT for Late Endovascular Reperfusion multinational cohort study was conducted at 66 sites across 10 countries from January 2014 to May 2022. This subanalysis included consecutive patients with late-window stroke due to an anterior circulation LVO, defined as occlusion of the internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery (M1/M2 segments), and a baseline NIHSS score ≤5 who received EVT or MM alone. The primary end point was a 90-day ordinal shift in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary outcomes were 90-day excellent outcome (defined as mRS scores 0-1 or return to baseline mRS score in patients with a prestroke mRS score >1) and favorable outcome (defined as mRS scores 0-2 or return to baseline mRS score in patients with prestroke mRS score >2). Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality. We used ordinal and binary logistic regression models to test for outcome differences.Results:Among 5,098 patients, 318 patients were included (median [interquartile range] age 67 [56-76] years; 149 [46.9%] were female; baseline NIHSS score was 4 [2-5]). A total of 202 patients (63.5%) received EVT and 116 MM (36.5%). There was no difference in favorable 90-day ordinal mRS score shift (adjusted common odds ratio [OR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.45-1.32), excellent outcome (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49-1.50), or favorable outcome (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35-1.50) in the EVT group compared with MM.

The retrospective and observational design limits our findings. Ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further insight.Classification of evidence:This study provides Class III evidence that in adult patients with anterior circulation LVO and low NIHSS score (≤5) presenting in the late time window (6-24 hours), EVT does not improve clinical outcome vs MM.Trial registration:This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov underNCT04096248.",Neurology,00/00/0000

To address these obstacles, a multiple step strategy is designed. Initially, literature review and bioinformatics analysis to screen a set of antigens that are heterogeneously expressed in GBM, which are designated as the target-bank, are leveraged. Then, according to the multiplex immunohistochemistry results of each patient's tumor sample, a personalized panel of antigens based on the principle that most cancer cells in tumor tissues can be covered from the target-bank is selected. To target these antigens, Vδ1 T cells are chosen as CAR vehicles because of its high tissue infiltration and off-the-shelf properties, and an optimized protocol for engineering CAR-Vδ1 T cells with high purity and cytotoxicity, low exhaustion, and cytokine release is developed. Next, the specific panel of cocktail CAR-Vδ1 T cells in the GBM organoids that are directly derived from the same patient's tumor is tested. The term ""prof"" cocktail therapy is coined to describe the approach using precise and rational combination of tumor antigens, organoid-based evaluation, and fitness of Vδ1 T cells.

While sleep homeostasis and cognitive processes are linked through cellular and synaptic plasticity, the signaling pathways connecting them remain unclear. Here, we show that Drosophila insomniac (inc) short sleep mutants, which lack an adaptor protein for the autism-associated Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase, exhibited enhanced Pavlovian aversive olfactory learning and memory, unlike other sleep mutants with normal or reduced memory. Through a genetic modifier screen, we found that a mild reduction of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling specifically rescued the sleep and longevity phenotypes of inc mutants. However, this reduction further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth. Since inc mutants displayed higher PKA signaling, we propose that inc loss-of-function suppresses sleep via increased PKA activity, which also constrains the excessive memory of inc mutants. Our data identify a signaling cascade for balancing sleep and memory functions, and provide a plausible explanation for the sleep phenotypes of inc mutants, suggesting that memory hyperfunction can provoke sleep deficits.",PLoS Biol,20/03/2025

Responding to developmental and environmental factors, metabolic changes can be rapidly and adaptively altered. The objective of the present study was to determine biological and technical determinants of metabolic changes during postnatal lung development. Over 118 metabolic features were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, Sciex QTRAP 5500 Triple Quadrupole). Biological determinants of metabolic changes were the transition from the postnatal saccular to alveolar stages and exposure to 85% hyperoxia, an environmental insult. Technical determinants of metabolic identification were brevity and temperature of harvesting, both of which improved metabolic preservation within samples. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed the transition between stages of lung development as the period of major metabolic alteration. Of three distinctive groups that clustered by age, the saccular stage was identified by its enrichment of both glycolytic and fatty acid derivatives. The critical transition between stages of development were denoted by changes in amino acid derivatives. Of the amino acid derivatives that significantly changed, a majority were linked to metabolites of the one-carbon metabolic pathway. The enrichment of one-carbon metabolites was independent of age and environmental insult. Temperature was also found to significantly influence the metabolic levels within the postmortem sampled lung, which underscored the importance of methodology. Collectively, these data support not only distinctive stages of metabolic change but also highlight amino acid metabolism, in particular one-carbon metabolites as metabolic signatures of the early postnatal lung.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,01/04/2021

Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) transport damaged mitochondrial components to lysosomes or the extracellular space. While many metabolites are known to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, it is largely unclear whether they are involved in MDV generation. Here, we discovered that the major component of ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), improved mitochondrial functions by facilitating the biogenesis of MDVs. Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury. Altogether, our research uncovers the fact that metabolites influence the formation of MDVs by directly engaging in post-translational modifications of key protein machineries and establishes a framework for understanding how metabolites regulate mitochondrial functions.",Mol Cell,14/03/2025

Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD+levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD+and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction.

However, the relationship between nuclear architecture, genome organization, chromosome stability and health remains poorly defined. Studies exploring the connections between the positioning and mobility of damaged DNA relative to various nuclear structures and genomic loci have revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic processes that affect chromosome stability. In this Review, we discuss the dynamic mechanisms that regulate nuclear and genome organization to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, genome stability and cell survival. Genome dynamics that support DSB repair rely on chromatin states, repair-protein condensates, nuclear or cytoplasmic microtubules and actin filaments, kinesin or myosin motor proteins, the nuclear envelope, various nuclear compartments, chromosome topology, chromatin loop extrusion and diverse signalling cues. These processes are commonly altered in cancer and during natural or premature ageing. Indeed, the reshaping of the genome in nuclear space during DSB repair points to new avenues for therapeutic interventions that may take advantage of new cancer cell vulnerabilities or aim to reverse age-associated defects.",Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,17/03/2025
10.1016/j.redox.2025.103593,Keap1-independent Nrf2 regulation: A novel therapeutic target for treating kidney disease,"Jiahui Zhang, Mingzhuo Zhang, Marc Tatar, Rujun Gong","The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of antioxidant responses in mammals, where it plays a critical role in detoxification, maintaining cellular homeostasis, combating inflammation and fibrosis, and slowing disease progression. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), an adaptor subunit of Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, serves as a critical sensor of oxidative and electrophilic stress, regulating Nrf2 activity by sequestering it in the cytoplasm, leading to its proteasomal degradation and transcriptional repression. However, the clinical potential of targeting the Keap1-dependent Nrf2 regulatory pathway has been limited. This is evidenced by early postnatal lethality in Keap1 knockout mice, as well as significant adverse events after pharmacological blockade of Keap1 in human patients with Alport syndrome as well as in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. The exact underlying mechanisms remain elusive, but may involve non-specific and systemic activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant response in both injured and normal tissues. Beyond Keap1-dependent regulation, Nrf2 activity is modulated by Keap1-independent mechanisms, including transcriptional, epigenetic, and post-translational modifications. In particular, GSK3β has emerged as a critical convergence point for these diverse signaling pathways. Unlike Keap1-dependent regulation, GSK3β-mediated Keap1-independent Nrf2 regulation does not affect basal Nrf2 activity but modulates its response at a delayed/late phase of cellular stress. This allows fine-tuning of the inducibility, magnitude, and duration of the Nrf2 response specifically in stressed or injured tissues. As one of the most metabolically active organs, the kidney is a major source of production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and also a vulnerable organ to oxidative damage. Targeting the GSK3β-mediated Nrf2 regulatory pathway represents a promising new approach for the treatment of kidney disease.",Redox Biol,12/03/2025

Here, we present a post-hoc subgroup analysis of IMROZ, a global, phase III, open-label study investigating isatuximab (Isa) with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) followed by Isa-Rd (n=265) versus VRd followed by Rd (n=181) in newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma (Ti NDMM) patients using the simplified International Myeloma Working Group (sIMWG) frailty score. Although patients aged >80 were excluded, there was no exclusion for patients meeting frailty criteria. All patients received standard VRd/Rd dosing; Isa-VRd patients received intravenous Isa (cycle 1, 10 mg/kg QW; cycles 2-17, Q2W; subsequent cycles, Q4W). Patients with a frailty score of 0/1 were considered non-frail; scores ≥2 were frail. Using this scoring, 26.7% of patients were frail (26.0% Isa-VRd; 27.6% VRd), and 72.0% non-frail (72.8% Isa-VRd; 70.7% VRd). After a median follow-up of 59.7 months, Isa-VRd significantly improved progression-free survival versus VRd in frail patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.518; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.294-0.912, P=0.0227) and non-frail patients (HR 0.615; 95% CI 0.419-0.903, P=0.0131). Significantly more frail patients receiving Isa-VRd than VRd achieved minimal residual disease negativity and complete response (odds ratio 3.459 [95% CI 1.495-8.006], P=0.0030, 10-5 by next-generation sequencing). Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to definitive discontinuation were similar between both arms regardless of frailty status. This post-hoc subgroup analysis of the IMROZ trial demonstrated that Isa-VRd is an effective option with a manageable safety profile for frail patients with Ti NDMM.",Haematologica,20/03/2025
10.1038/s41598-025-94303-8,Multi-omic biomarkers associated with multiple sclerosis: from Mendelian randomization to drug prediction,"Wei Yang, Chenglin Liu, Zhenhua Li, Miao Cui","Currently, the treatment and prevention of multiple sclerosis (MS) continue to encounter significant challenges. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis has emerged as a crucial research method in the pursuit of new therapeutic strategies. Accordingly, we hypothesize that there exists a causal association between genetic variants of specific plasma proteins and MS through MR mechanisms, and that key therapeutic targets can be precisely identified by integrating multi-omics analytical approaches. In this study, we developed a comprehensive analytical framework aimed at identifying and validating potential therapeutic targets for MS. The framework commenced with a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing two large plasma protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) datasets. Building on this foundation, we performed Bayesian co-localization analysis of coding genes, followed by a full phenotype-wide association study (PheWAS) on the co-positive genes identified through both analytical methods. This approach allowed us to explore the functions of key genes and the mechanisms of co-morbidity associated with the disease. Subsequently, we integrated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to facilitate drug prediction and molecular docking studies. This study conducted a systematic analysis between two large plasma pQTLs datasets and MS. In the MR analysis, the MR analysis of Icelandic plasma pQTLs and MS identified 88 positive plasma proteins, while the MR analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs and MS identified 122 positive plasma proteins. By comparison, uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) and glutathione S-transferase theta 2B (GSTT2B) were found to be the positive proteins shared by the two datasets. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was a significantly positive protein in the analysis of Icelandic plasma pQTLs. In the analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs, advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1 (BTN1A1), cluster of differentiation 58 (CD58), desmoglein 4 (DSG4), ecotropic viral integration site 5 (EVI5), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14 (TNFRSF14) were significantly positive proteins. After Bonferroni correction, AGER, CD58, EVI5, and TNF remained significantly positive proteins in the analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs. In the Bayesian colocalization analysis, EVI5 (PPH4 = 0.9800), O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (PPH4 = 0.8569), and TNFRSF14 (PPH4 = 0.8904) were the common positive genes in the two analysis methods. In conclusion, EVI5, OGA, and TNFRSF14 may be potential therapeutic targets for MS. Through the comprehensive application of MR analysis and Bayesian colocalization analysis, we have successfully identified that EVI5, OGA, and TNFRSF14 may be key therapeutic targets for MS. These findings may provide a scientific basis for the development of novel immunotherapies, combination treatment regimens, or targeted intervention strategies.",Sci Rep,19/03/2025

There is a paucity of evidence concerning the benefit of dexamethasone to prevent death in paediatric pneumococcal meningitis. We aimed to compare the effect of early adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone versus no dexamethasone on death in children with pneumococcal meningitis.Methods:We did a non-randomised, comparative, multicentre, retrospective, quasi-experimental, propensity score-based study using data from a French national surveillance system of pneumococcal meningitis in children that collates data for 238 French paediatric wards working with 168 microbiology laboratories. We compared outcomes of adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone treatment (0·15 mg/kg every 6 h, for 4 days, per national guidelines) given within 12 h of antibiotic treatment versus no dexamethasone among all children aged 0-17 years with confirmed pneumococcal meningitis who had been hospitalised in one of the participating centres between Jan 1, 2005, and Nov 1, 2022. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause death after hospital admission. The main propensity score analysis was based on inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW), allowing adjustment for initial severity and baseline characteristics. Sensitivity analyses, such as propensity score matching, were done to assess the robustness of the results.Findings:Between Jan 1, 2005, and Nov 1, 2022, 1765 cases of pneumococcal meningitis were reported to the National Surveillance System of Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis. 534 were excluded from the analysis and 1231 were included, with a median age of 1·1 years (IQR 0·5-5·0, range 0-17·9). 495 (40%) of 1231 patients were female, 716 (58%) were male, and 20 (1%) were missing data for sex. 650 (53%) of 1231 children received dexamethasone and 581 (47%) children did not receive dexamethasone. 108 (9%) of 1231 patients died. Within 30 days of hospitalisation, 105 (9%) patients died, 36 (6%) of 650 in the dexamethasone group and 69 (12%) of 581 in the no dexamethasone group. After IPTW, the adjusted 30-day death rate was 6% in the dexamethasone group and 12% in the no dexamethasone group (marginal odds ratio 0·39, 95% CI 0·23-0·65). All sensitivity analyses gave similar results.Interpretation:Adjunctive dexamethasone within 12 h of starting antibiotic treatment was associated with a reduced 30-day risk of death in children hospitalised with pneumococcal meningitis. Our findings support the use of dexamethasone to reduce the risk of death in paediatric pneumococcal meningitis.Funding:Pfizer, ACTIV, and National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) Centre.",Lancet Child Adolesc Health,00/00/0000

Analyzing AIP-associated regulatory gene networks can aid in identifying key regulatory mechanism(s) underlying foamy macrophage formation. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis on the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) patient cohort identifies AIP as a negative correlate of Histocompatibility Minor 13 (HM13), which encodes the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) protein Signal Peptide Peptidase (HM13/SPP). The negative correlation between AIP and HM13/SPP on mRNA and protein levels is validated in oxLDL-stimulated macrophages and human plaque foamy macrophages. Mechanistically, AIP, via its chaperone interaction with Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR), inhibits p38-c-JUN-mediated HM13 transactivation, thereby suppressing macrophage lipid accumulation. Myeloid HM13/SPP overexpression enhances oxLDL-induced foamy macrophage formation in vitro as well as atherogenesis and plaque foamy macrophage load in vivo, while myeloid HM13/SPP knockout produces the opposite effects. Mechanistically, myeloid HM13/SPP enhances oxLDL-induced foamy macrophage formation in vitro as well as atherogenesis and plaque foamy macrophage load in vivo via promoting ERAD-mediated proteasomal degradation of the metabolic regulator Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1).

10.1016/j.pharmthera.2025.108844,Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: Pathogenesis and therapeutic targets,"Yi Chu, Su Yang, Xiaodong Chen","Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has emerged as a significant hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, with its prevalence increasing globally alongside the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. MAFLD represents a continuum of liver damage, spanning from uncomplicated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This condition can advance to more severe outcomes, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are a family of four receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4) that interact with both paracrine and endocrine fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). This interaction activates the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase residues, thereby triggering downstream signaling pathways, including RAS-MAPK, JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT, and PLCγ. In the context of MAFLD, paracrine FGF-FGFR signaling is predominantly biased toward the development of liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis. In contrast, endocrine FGF-FGFR signaling is primarily biased toward regulating the metabolism of bile acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and phosphate, as well as maintaining the overall balance of energy metabolism in the body. The interplay between these biased signaling pathways significantly influences the progression of MAFLD. This review explores the critical functions of FGFR signaling in MAFLD from three perspectives: first, it examines the primary roles of FGFRs relative to their structure; second, it summarizes FGFR signaling in hepatic lipid metabolism, elucidating mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of MAFLD; finally, it highlights recent advancements in drug development aimed at targeting FGFR signaling for the treatment of MAFLD and its associated diseases.",Pharmacol Ther,18/03/2025
10.1016/j.canlet.2025.217643,FUT2-dependent fucosylation of LAMP1 promotes the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by regulating the autophagy-lysosomal pathway,"Zijun Guo, Lingnan He, Weijun Wang, Shuxin Tian, Rong Lin","Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is an enzyme that adds fucose to proteins or lipids via α-1,2-fucosylation in the intestinal mucosa. While FUT2 deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear, and the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. We established an azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model to induce CRC. FUT2 expression was assessed in human CRC tissues, AOM/DSS-induced mouse models, and CRC cell lines using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and UEA-I staining. FUT2 knockout (FUT2△IEC) mice were treated with AOM/DSS, and FUT2-overexpressing CRC cells were created to evaluate the effects of FUT2 on apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo settings through western blot analyses and functional assays. N-glycoproteomics, UEA-I chromatography, and co-immunoprecipitation were utilized to identify regulatory mechanisms and target fucosylated proteins. FUT2 expression and α-1,2-fucosylation were significantly decreased in CRC. FUT2 deficiency worsened AOM/DSS-induced CRC and reduced tumor apoptosis, while FUT2 overexpression induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in CRC cells and xenografts. Mechanistically, FUT2 appears to suppress autophagy by impairing lysosomal function and directly targeting and fucosylating LAMP1, contributing to lysosomal dysfunction. Our study reveals a fucosylation-dependent antitumor mechanism of FUT2 in CRC, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for CRC treatment.",Cancer Lett,18/03/2025

EMBARC recruited participants with MDD (aged 18-65 years) at 4 academic sites across the US between August 2011 and December 2015. CANBIND-1 recruited participants with MDD from 6 outpatient centers across Canada between August 2013 and December 2016. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to May 2024.Main outcomes and measures:Prediction performance for treatment response was assessed using balanced classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). In secondary analyses, prediction performance was assessed using observed vs predicted correlations between change in depression severity.Results:In 363 adult patients (225 from EMBARC and 138 from CANBIND-1; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [13.1] years; 235 women [64.7%]), the best-performing models using pretreatment clinical features and functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior cingulate had moderate cross-trial generalizability for antidepressant treatment (trained on CANBIND-1 and tested on EMBARC, AUC = 0.62 for stage 1 and AUC = 0.67 for stage 2; trained on EMBARC stage 1 and tested on CANBIND-1, AUC = 0.66). The addition of neuroimaging features improved the prediction performance of antidepressant response compared with clinical features only. The use of early-treatment (week 2) instead of pretreatment depression severity scores resulted in the best generalization performance, comparable to within-trial performance. Multivariate regressions showed substantial cross-trial generalizability in change in depression severity (predicted vs observed r ranging from 0.31 to 0.39).Conclusions and relevance:In this prognostic study of depression outcomes, models predicting response to antidepressants show substantial generalizability across different RCTs of adult MDD.",JAMA Netw Open,03/03/2025

Impaired intracellular degradation pathways further exacerbate the accumulation of pathological tau. A new strategy - targeted protein degradation - recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein close to the degradation machinery to promote clearance. Since 2016, this strategy has been applied to tau pathologies and attracted broad interest in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. However, a systematic review of recent studies on tau degradation mechanisms is lacking. Here we review tau degradation mechanisms (the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway), their dysfunction in AD, and tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras and autophagy-targeting chimeras. We emphasize the need for a continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for developing tau-targeted degraders, encouraging researchers to work on new treatment options for AD patients.

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed to predict the core targets and pathways of Aloin against CP/CPPS. The effects of Aloin in ameliorating CP/CPPS were verified in animal experiments.Results:A total of 235 genes interacting with Aloin in CP/CPPS were identified. PPI network analysis revealed five core targets: AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, HSP90AA1, and SRC. GO analysis yielded 2916 enrichment results, with 2562 related to Biological Process (BP), 94 to Cellular Component (CC), and 260 to Molecular Function (MF). KEGG pathway analysis identified 172 pathways. Molecular docking confirmed stable binding between Aloin and core targets. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated binding stability by analyzing Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), hydrogen bonds, Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), and Gibbs free energy of Aloin-target complexes. Experimental validation showed that Aloin alleviated pain, reduced inflammatory factors, and decreased oxidative stress in a rat model of CP/CPPS. The qRT-PCR results showed that Aloin intervention reduced the mRNA expression of AKT1, EGFR, HSP90AA1, and SRC, while increasing ESR1 mRNA expression. These changes may underlie its therapeutic effects in CP/CPPS.Conclusion:Our study revealed that Aloin exerts a beneficial effect on mitigating the pain symptoms associated with CP/CPPS, ameliorating inflammation, and reducing oxidative stress. Through network pharmacology, potential targets and signaling pathways were identified, suggesting the therapeutic promise of Aloin for CP/CPPS.

The etiology of RA is complex, involving genetic factors like HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1, as well as environmental influences, particularly smoking, which heightens disease risk. Affecting approximately 1% of the global population, RA is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, with its prevalence expected to increase due to demographic shifts, especially in certain regions. RA symptoms commonly manifest between ages 35 and 60 but can also affect children under 16 in cases of juvenile RA. Symptoms include prolonged joint stiffness, pain, fatigue, and, in advanced cases, joint deformities. Current treatment approaches involve disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and glucocorticoids to manage symptoms and slow disease progression, though these treatments often present limitations due to adverse effects and varied patient response. The identification of genetic markers, such as HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, supports the growing emphasis on personalized treatment strategies that account for genetic and lifestyle factors. Non-pharmacological approaches - diet adjustments, physical activity, and stress management - are increasingly valued for their complementary role in RA management. Lifestyle interventions, including whole-food, plant-based diets and physical therapy, show promise in reducing inflammation and improving joint function. Technological advancements, like telemedicine, mobile health applications, and artificial intelligence, are enhancing RA diagnosis and treatment, making care more precise and accessible. Despite these advancements, RA remains incurable, necessitating continued research into novel therapeutic targets and approaches.

However, patients inevitably develop acquired drug resistance, resulting in recurrence or metastasis. It is important to identify novel effective therapeutic targets to reverse acquired TKI resistance.Results:Bioinformatics analysis revealed that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was upregulated in EGFR-TKI resistant cells and tissues via EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation. High NNMT levels were correlated with poor prognosis in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, which could promote resistance to EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NNMT catalyzed the conversion of nicotinamide to 1-methyl nicotinamide by depleting S-adenosyl methionine (the methyl group donor), leading to a reduction in H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and subsequent epigenetic activation of EGR1 and ALDH3A1. In addition, ALDH3A1 activation increased lactic acid levels, which further promoted NNMT expression via p300-mediated histone H3K18 lactylation on its promoter. Thus, NNMT mediates the formation of a double positive feedback loop via EGR1 and lactate, EGR1/NNMT/EGR1 and NNMT/ALDH3A1/lactate/NNMT. Moreover, the combination of a small-molecule inhibitor for NNMT (NNMTi) and osimertinib exhibited promising potential for the treatment of TKI resistance in an NSCLC osimertinib-resistant xenograft model.Conclusions:The combined contribution of these two positive feedback loops promotes EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Our findings provide new insight into the role of histone methylation and histone lactylation in TKI resistance. The pivotal NNMT-mediated positive feedback loop may serve as a powerful therapeutic target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC.",Mol Cancer,15/03/2025

Consequently, there is a growing need for, ideally, non-invasive biomarkers. Liquid biopsy, a diagnostic approach analyzing circulating tumor components in body fluids, has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for various cancers, including PCa.Methods:To evaluate recent evidence on urine-based biomarkers for the detection of PCa, we conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Our literature search identified a total of 286 studies, of which 66 met our inclusion criteria (men suspected of PCa with no prior history of PCa). After assessing the risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool, studies on five distinct urinary biomarker tests were included for further analysis.Results:Tests that do not rely on digital rectal examination (non-DRE), such as Exosome Dx Prostate IntelliScore (EPI) and Protexam Prostate Status Management (PSM)/Prostate Check-Up (PSU), demonstrated strong performance in detecting PCa, particularly clinically significant PCa. Meanwhile, the MyProstateScore test (MPS) showed the highest efficacy among tests utilizing urine samples collected post-DRE. Unfortunately, the performance of the biomarker test with the most available studies, PCA3 ProGensa® Score, was underwhelming with only moderate sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions:Despite promising results from various urine-based biomarker tests, we are currently unable to recommend one specific test for implementation into clinical practice.

First, we showed that TMEM63B is expressed in SFO excitatory neurons and required for the neuronal responses to hypertonic stimulation. More importantly, heterologously expressed TMEM63B is activated by hypertonic stimuli, and point mutations can alter the reversal potential of the channel. Additionally, purified TMEM63B in liposomes exhibits osmolarity-gated currents. Finally, Tmem63b knockout mice have profound deficits in thirst, and deleting TMEM63B within SFO neurons recapitulated this phenotype. Taken together, these results provide a molecular basis for thirst and suggest that TMEM63B is a mammalian hyperosmolar sensor for thirst.",Neuron,11/03/2025
10.1016/j.biomaterials.2025.123253,Phase-adapted metal ion supply for spinal cord repair with a Mg-Zn incorporated chimeric microsphere,"Xiangyu Liu, Biao Ma, Sihan Hu, Dandan Li, Chun Pan, Zhuobin Xu, Hao Chen, Yongxiang Wang, Huihui Wang","Dynamic alterations in metal ion concentrations are observed in the pathological process of spinal cord injury (SCI). Hence, strategically supplying metal ions in a phase-adapted manner is promising to facilitate injured spinal cord repair by preventing pathological damage. To achieve this, a chimeric hydrogel microsphere with Mg2+-crosslinked methacrylate gelatin as the ""shell"" and Zn2+-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the ""core"" was designed. The chimeric microspheres allow continuous delivery of Mg2+or Zn2+at the exact required phase in SCI pathological process. Early release of Mg2+reduced inflammation by diminishing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines due to changes in macrophage polarization, which further suppressed scar formation to create an ideal space for neural regeneration. The subsequently released Zn2+at the late phase effectively promoted neural cell proliferation and regeneration, which was accompanied by activation of mature neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons, leading to significant behavioral recovery. Thus, this study underscores the critical role of metal ions at different phases of injured spinal cord repair and describes the construction of an injectable chimeric hydrogel microsphere carrying distinct metal ions with a core-shell structure. Chimeric microspheres overcome the discrepancy between the inflammatory response and neural regeneration and are a promising therapeutic strategy for injured spinal cord repair.",Biomaterials,11/03/2025

Risk factor assessment requires laboratory or physical measurements. We aimed to determine whether self-reported risk factors serve as reliable proxies and predict stroke- and dementia-related mortality.Methods and results:We used cross-sectional data from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) from 1999 to 2018 linked to National Death Index records. We included participants with available data on self-reported and measured hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, kidney disease, hearing impairment and overweight. Reliability was assessed using F1 scores, and used survey-weighted Cox-proportional hazards models evaluated associations with stroke- or dementia-related mortality. Reliability of self-reported risk factors was highest in overweight (F1 score 0.81, sensitivity 76%, specificity 77%) and diabetes (F1 score 0.71, sensitivity 77%, specificity 97%) and lowest for kidney disease (F1 score 0.25, sensitivity 16%, specificity 98%). Self-reported hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.14-1.94]) and diabetes (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.18-2.12]) were associated with stroke-related mortality, comparable to measured risk factors. For dementia-related mortality, only measured hearing impairment (all dementia cases had hearing impairment at baseline) and both self-reported (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.37-0.68]) and measured overweight (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.52-0.93]) were associated.Conclusions:In conclusion, the reliability and validity of self-reported risk factors for stroke and dementia differ between risk factors. Although self-reported measures vary in their reliability, they perform equally as well as objective metrics for evaluating the risk of stroke- and dementia-related mortality.",J Am Heart Assoc,21/03/2025

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that PAP therapy is associated with reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with OSA.Methods:For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from database inception to Aug 22, 2023 (updated Sept 9, 2024), with no language or geographical restrictions. Reference lists of eligible studies and recent conference abstracts (2022-23) were also reviewed. We included outpatient studies (randomised controlled trials [RCTs] or confounder-adjusted, non-randomised controlled studies [NRCSs]) assessing the incidence of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or both in adults (aged ≥18 years) with OSA who were treated versus not treated with PAP; other study types and studies that evaluated only PAP adherence were excluded. Abstracts of all retrieved publications were independently screened by two of three researchers (BS, SRB, and KCW), with disagreements resolved by adjudication from another researcher (SHM). The AutoLit feature of the Nested Knowledge platform was used for the review and data-extraction phases. We analysed each log-transformed hazard ratio (HR) and SE using a linear random-effects model to estimate overall HRs and 95% CIs. To evaluate the risk of bias, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for NRCSs. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456627.Findings:Of 5484 records identified by our search, 435 were assessed for eligibility and 30 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (ten RCTs and 20 NRCSs). These studies included 1 175 615 participants, of whom 905 224 (77%) were male and 270 391 (23%) were female (SE 1·9), with a mean age of 59·5 (SE 1·4) years and a mean follow-up of 5·1 (0·5) years. The risk of bias was low to moderate. The risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·56-0·72; p<0·0001) and cardiovascular mortality (0·45, 0·29-0·72; p<0·0001) was significantly lower in the PAP group than in the no-PAP group, and the clinically relevant benefit of PAP therapy increased with use.Interpretation:Our results are consistent with a potentially beneficial effect of PAP therapy on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with OSA. Patients should be made aware of this effect of their treatment, which could result in greater acceptance of treatment initiation and greater adherence, leading to a higher likelihood of improved outcomes.Funding:ResMed.",Lancet Respir Med,18/03/2025

We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts.

The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance of rats. Firstly, increased inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-10(IL-10)) and decreased tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1)) in rat colon were observed. Secondly, untargeted metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) revealed that TRP metabolism was the most prominently affected. Thirdly, quantification of TRP and its metabolites via prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a QTRAP 5500 mass (UFLC-QTRAP-5500/MS) showed that TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) were significantly increased. At the same time, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was unchanged and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly decreased in the colon of CRS rats. Besides, TRP metabolic enzyme changes were with the same trends as the corresponding metabolites. Thus, our data showed that CRS could initiate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and colonic metabolism disturbance, especially TRP-KYN metabolism pathway of rats, which may provide an experimental background for future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic exposure to psychological stress could induce metabolic imbalance of the body, and stressful life events were intimately correlated with frequent relapses in patients with intestinal disorders. The present study showed that chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance, especially tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism of rats. Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway may be involved in the initiation and development of diseases induced by chronic stress.

Further, this triplication possibly contributes to dysregulation of the immune system, furthering AD pathophysiology.Methods:Using Olink Explore 3072, we measured ∼3000 proteins in plasma from 73 adults with DS and 15 euploid, healthy controls (HC). Analyses for differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were carried out, and pathway and protein network enrichment using Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and STRING database was investigated. Within DS, the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) feature selection was applied.Results:We identified 253 DEP between DS and HC and 142 DEP between symptomatic and asymptomatic DS. Several pathways regarding inflammatory and neurodevelopmental processes were dysregulated in both analyses. LASSO feature selection within DS returned 15 proteins as potential blood markers.Discussion:This exploratory proteomic analysis found potential new blood biomarkers for diagnosing DS-AD in need of further investigation.Highlights:Inflammatory pathways are dysregulated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic DS.

Fulminant myocarditis is a rare irAE, but lower-severity cardiac events are being reported more frequently, leading to an unmet need for irAE prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment, especially for long-life-expectancy patients. We recruited 57 patients, stratified according to therapy regime (monotherapy (30%) or combination (33%) cohort) or history of cardiac disease or presence of at least two cardiovascular risk factors other than prior or active smoking (cardiovascular cohort (37%)). We performed a complete cardiological assessment with clinical visit, 12-lead ECG, multiparametric cardiac MRI as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cell immunophenotyping, prior to ICI initiation and around 2 months later. ICI treatment was associated with a significant left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) reduction pre-ICI versus post-ICI treatment (60.1±8% to 58.1±8%, p=0.002, paired t-test) and more than 3% LVEF loss in a substantial proportion of patients (18; 32%).

Specifically, existing research has suggested a significant correlation between NPAR and diabetic retinopathy, indicating its potential relevance to diabetic complications. However, despite diabetic kidney disease (DKD) being a complication that severely affects the quality of life of diabetic patients, the association between the prevalence of DKD and NPAR remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential link between NPAR and DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Methods:We extracted complete data on neutrophil percentage, plasma albumin, serum creatinine, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database spanning from 2009 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine the relationship between NPAR levels and DKD, and conducted sensitivity tests, subsequently employing Generalized Additive Models combined with smooth curve fitting methods to explore the relationships among variables. Then, subgroup analyses were conducted on the association between NPAR and DKD to investigate changes in the relationship across different subgroups. Finally, Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive performance of the independent variable, NPAR, for the dependent variable, DKD.Results:A total of 2,263 participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio for DKD was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.08-1.90) for the second quartile group, 1.75 (95% CI: 1.33-2.31) for the third quartile group, and 2.95 (95% CI: 2.22-3.93) for the fourth quartile group. Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a positive correlation was observed between NPAR and DKD. Results from subgroup analyses showed no significant differences among different populations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that NPAR had good predictive performance for DKD.Conclusion:The prevalence of DKD indicated a positive association with NPAR among individuals with T2DM.

In spite of the substantial occurrence rate of BC, the early stage of this disease is generally regarded as curable. However, intra-tumor heterogeneity presents a formidable obstacle to the success of effective treatment.Method:In this research, single cell RNA sequencing was utilized to dissect the tumor microenvironment within BC. Slingshot, CytoTRACE and Monocle 2 were applied to illustrate the differentiation process of each subpopulation in the pseudotime sequence. To comprehensively comprehend the tumor cells (TCs) in BC, an analysis of upstream transcription factors was carried out via pySCENIC, while downstream pathway enrichment was conducted through KEGG, GO and GSEA. The prognosis model was established based on the bulk data obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. Knock-down experiments were also implemented to explore the function of the transcription factorCEBPDin the TCs.Results:Our in-depth analysis identified eight principal cell types. Notably, TCs were predominantly found within epithelial cells. The classification of TCs further uncovered five unique subpopulations, with one subpopulation characterized by highUGDHexpression. This subpopulation was shown to possess distinct metabolic features in metabolism-related investigations. The intricate communication modalities among different cell types were effectively demonstrated by means of CellChat. Additionally, a crucial transcription factor,CEBPD, was identified, which demonstrated a pronounced propensity towards tumors and harbored potential tumor-advancing characteristics. Its role in promoting cancer was subsequently verified throughin vitroknock-down experiments. Moreover, a prognostic model was also developed, and a risk score was established based on the genes incorporated in the model. Through comparing the prognoses of different UTRS levels, it was determined that the group with a high UTRS had a less favorable prognosis.Conclusion:These outcomes contributed to the elucidation of the complex interrelationships within the BC tumor microenvironment. By specifically targeting certain subpopulations of TCs, novel treatment strategies could potentially be devised. This study shed light on the direction that future research in BC should take, furnishing valuable information that can be utilized to enhance treatment regimens.",Front Immunol,06/03/2025

Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 improved cardiac dysfunction and ameliorated cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice. Moreover, Piezo1 deficiency also attenuated mitochondrial impairment. Piezo1fl/fldiabetic mice exhibited increased calpain activity and excessive mitochondrial fission mediated by Drp1 and obvious reduced fusion; however, Piezo1 deficiency restored calpain levels and mitochondrial dysfunction. These observations were also corroborated in H9C2 cells and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 increased phosphorylation of Drp1 and ERK1/2 in vivo and in vitro. Piezo1 knockout or treatment with inhibitor improved mitochondrial function.Conclusions:This study provides the first evidence that Piezo1 is elevated in DCM through the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, which is reversed by Piezo1 deficiency. Thus, Piezo1 inhibition may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DCM.",Cardiovasc Diabetol,20/03/2025

Pathogenetic variants inMT-ATP6/8cause incurable mitochondrial syndromes encompassing a wide spectrum of clinical features including ataxia, motor and language developmental delay, deafness, retinitis pigmentosa, and Leigh pattern in brain MRI. Typically, higher levels of mtDNA variants lead to more severe symptomatology although even individuals with similar mtDNA mutational loads exhibit high clinical variability. Hence, the establishment of potential therapeutics is currently challenging. In this article, we present an international multicenter study designed to provide a retrospective natural history of patients with MT-ATP6/8 deficiency and to identify primary and secondary end points for future clinical trials.Methods:Clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetics data of patients with genetically confirmedMT-ATP6/8defects were collected and analyzed from Italian, German, US, and Spain national reference centers through ethical committee-approved mitochondrial patients' national registries or local programs.Results:A cohort of 111 patients, 98 unreported, were analyzed (55 male, 56 female). Patients had infantile-onset disease (<1 year) in 44% of cases, pediatric-onset (≥1 year and ≤12 years) in 36%, and late-onset (>12 years) in 20%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference (pvalue = 0.0349) in the survival of infantile and pediatric patients compared with adult patients, although only 8% of patients were not alive at the last follow-up. The CNS was the most frequently affected tissue (93%), followed by the muscle (75%), eye (46%), and heart (18%). Brain MRI showed isolated Leigh-like lesions (58%), Leigh-like lesions and cortical and/or cerebellar atrophy (15%), isolated cerebellar atrophy (10%), and other lesions (21%). At the last follow-up, 11% of patients were wheelchair-bound. Metabolic acidosis or acute deterioration complicated the clinical course in ≅55% of early-onset patients. Molecular genetics studies identified 26 pathogenic variants (6 of them novel). Reduced citrulline levels and increased alanine and lactate levels were reported in 56%, 49%, and 71% of patients, respectively, suggesting their role as potential biomarkers.Discussion:Our results define a more accurate classification based on the age at onset for MT-ATPase deficiency and provide fundamental clinical and biochemical data for disease management.",Neurology,00/00/0000

It explores pathophysiological mechanisms, highlights recent biomarker discoveries, and evaluates contemporary and emerging lipid-lowering therapies tailored for CKD patients.Recent findings:Recent studies have highlighted the inadequacy of traditional lipid markers like LDL-C in reflecting cardiovascular risk in CKD. Novel biomarkers, such as remnant cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), demonstrate stronger associations with adverse outcomes. Emerging lipid-lowering agents, including bempedoic acid, pemafibrate, and PCSK9 inhibitors, show promise for risk reduction, especially in non-dialysis-dependent CKD. However, evidence remains limited for advanced stages of CKD and dialysis patients. Furthermore, alterations in lipid metabolism, such as dysfunctional HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are now recognized as significant contributors to CVD and renal damage in CKD populations. Dyslipidemia is a pivotal modifiable risk factor in CKD, exacerbating both cardiovascular risk and disease progression. While statins remain the cornerstone of therapy in early-to-moderate CKD, their efficacy diminishes in advanced stages. The advent of novel therapeutic options and a deeper understanding of dyslipidemia's pathophysiology hold potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize personalized approaches, focusing on the unique metabolic derangements of CKD and advancing treatments for high-risk and dialysis-dependent patients.",Curr Atheroscler Rep,21/03/2025

In addition, the blood lipid profile has been recognized as a significant factor influencing cognitive performance. However, the association between the ratio of total cholesterol (TC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cognitive function remains unclear.Methods:This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using data from middle-aged and older adults (aged ≥45 years) participating in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The primary exposure of interest was the ratio of TC to HDL-C, while the main outcome was cognitive function, assessed using cognition scores. The association between the TC-HDL-C ratio and cognitive performance was examined using multiple linear regression analyses and restricted cubic spline modeling to assess potential nonlinear relationships.Results:A total of 8,914 participants were included in the analysis. Within a certain range, a higher TC-HDL-C ratio was significantly associated with improved cognitive scores (p< 0.05) among middle-aged and older adults. This relationship remained significant even after adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related factors. Moreover, restricted cubic spline analyses revealed a significant nonlinear association (p for nonlinearity <0.05) between the TC-HDL-C ratio and cognition scores. Subgroup analyses further highlighted differential effects of the TC-HDL-C ratio across specific population subgroups. Sensitivity analyses consistently supported the robustness of the observed relationship between the TC-HDL-C ratio and cognitive function.Conclusion:Our findings confirm a significant nonlinear relationship between the TC-HDL-C ratio and cognitive performance in middle-aged and elderly individuals, even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. These results underscore the potential importance of maintaining an appropriate TC-HDL-C ratio to support cognitive health in aging populations.",Front Nutr,05/03/2025

For 25 years, palivizumab has been the only effective pharmaceutical RSV preventive.Areas covered:We summarize the development and a quarter-century of real-world evidence with palivizumab. We highlight its positive impact on the burden of RSV in high-risk children. Based on lessons learnt from its implementation, we suggest strategies for effective and equitable deployment of newer RSV preventives.Expert opinion:Following failure of the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine in 1967, RSV intravenous immunoglobulin was approved in 1996 after three decades' research. Subsequently, palivizumab emerged as the most effective and safe RSV preventive, demonstrated by the IMpact trial, and was licensed in 1998 in the United States. Over the last 25 years, the benefits of palivizumab have been firmly established through a wealth of evidence, predominantly from high-income countries (HICs). To achieve a global impact with the newer RSV preventives, evidenced-based universal guidelines must be developed and endorsed by regulatory authorities and relevant scientific societies. Independent economic evaluations should incorporate all RSV-associated healthcare costs, reduction of long-term respiratory sequelae, and standardized outcomes. Most importantly, equity in product availability and implementation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is essential.",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,20/03/2025

Many people with AUD do not respond to psychosocial or pharmacological interventions when these are provided alone. Combining these interventions may improve the response to treatment, though evidence remains limited.Objectives:To assess the effects of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of AUD in adults.Search methods:We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in November 2023, without language restrictions.Selection criteria:We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions versus pharmacological or psychosocial interventions alone, or no intervention/treatment as usual (TAU), in adults with AUD. Our primary outcomes were continuous abstinent participants, frequency of use (measured as heavy drinkers, percentages of abstinent days, heavy-drinking days), amount of use (number of drinks per drinking day), adverse events, serious adverse events, dropouts from treatment, and dropouts due to adverse events.Data collection and analysis:We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.Main results:We included 21 RCTs (4746 participants). The most studied pharmacological and psychosocial interventions were naltrexone (81.0%) and cognitive behavioural therapy (66.7%), respectively. Most participants were men (74%), aged about 44 years, with AUD, without comorbid mental disorders or other substance use disorders; 15 RCTs detoxified participants before treatment. We judged 28.5% of the studies as at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, performance bias for objective and subjective outcomes, and detection bias for subjective outcomes; all studies were at low risk of detection bias for objective outcomes; 85.7% of studies were at low risk of attrition bias; 14.2% of studies were at low risk of reporting bias. 1) Compared to psychosocial intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions probably reduce the number of heavy drinkers (above the clinically meaningful threshold (MID) of 2%; absolute difference (AD) -10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18% to -2%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97; 8 studies, 1609 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may increase continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 5%, 95% CI 1% to 11%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34; 6 studies, 1184 participants; low-certainty evidence). They probably have little to no effect on: • the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.08; 10 studies, 2227 participants); • serious adverse events (MID 1%; AD -2%, 95% CI -3% to 0%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.12; 4 studies; 524 participants); • dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD -3%, 95% CI -5% to 0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01; 15 studies, 3021 participants); and • dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 2%, 95% CI 0% to 5%; RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.52; 8 studies, 1572 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence). They may have little to no effect on: • heavy-drinking days (MID 5%; MD -3.49, 95% CI -8.68 to 1.70; 4 studies, 470 participants); • number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.01; 7 studies, 805 participants); and • adverse events (MID 30%; AD 17%, 95% CI -5% to 46%; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.68; 4 studies, 508 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). 2) Compared to pharmacological intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on: • the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD -1.18, 95% CI -4.42 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1158 participants); and • dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 1%, 95% CI -10 to 14%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; 3 studies, 1246 participants) (all low-certainty evidence).

The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.Authors' conclusions:As implications for practice, our findings indicate that adding pharmacological to psychosocial interventions is safe and helps people with AUD recover. These conclusions are based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Given the few studies and very low-certainty evidence, any benefits of adding psychosocial to pharmacological interventions or comparing the combined intervention to TAU are less clear. As implications for research, further studies should investigate the effects of the combined intervention compared to pharmacotherapy or TAU.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,20/03/2025

Recent clinical trials investigating sumoylation inhibition as a therapeutic approach for cancer have established that sumoylation has important immune modulatory effects. Sumoylation suppresses transcription factors in innate immune cells and in cytotoxic T cells through the direct modification of these factors, which leads to the recruitment of transcriptional repressor complexes containing histone deacetylases. By contrast, in regulatory T cells and T helper 17 cells, sumoylation of transcription factors can enhance transcriptional activity by recruiting transcriptional coactivators. Sumoylation is also involved in the repression of IFNB1 and endogenous retroviruses and is therefore important for regulating interferon expression. A central theme from literature is that the sumoylation of a group of proteins, instead of a single target, collectively contributes to the regulation of various immune processes. In this Review, we consider how these studies provide scientific basis for future exploration of SUMO-mediated immune modulation for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune disorders.",Nat Rev Immunol,19/03/2025

Natural essential oils are widely used for skin maintenance, while the molecular target and mechanism of action remain largely unknown. Here, we report that citronellal, a plant-derived acyclic monoterpene commonly used for personal care, stimulates skin renewal by promoting keratinocyte proliferation through the activation of TRPV3. We further present cryo-EM structures of human TRPV3 in complex with acyclic monoterpenes, including citronellal, citral, linalool and isodihydrolavandulal, determined at resolutions of 3.1-3.6 Å. Our structural and functional analysis unmasks consistent yet subtly different binding modes within the TRPV3 vanilloid site. Our results elucidate that essential oil ligands activate TRPV3 channels by competitively displacing endogenous lipids from the vanilloid site. Together, these findings identify TRPV3 as the molecular target of natural acyclic monoterpenes for skin renewal, and delineate the structural basis of action, thus being instrumental for moving forward skin healthcare.",Nat Commun,19/03/2025

Here we show, using a specialized method to isolate EC and microglial nuclei from postmortem human cortex (92 donors, 50 male and 42 female, aged 20-98 years), that intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes enables simultaneous profiling of nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts at a single-nucleus resolution. We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood-brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.",Nat Neurosci,14/03/2025

Elucidation from a spatial immune perspective has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying immune escape, effectively addressing the limitations of relying solely on the analysis of immune cell subpopulation transcriptional profiles. Advances in spatial omics technology enable researchers to precisely analyze precious liver metastasis samples in a high-throughput manner, revealing spatial alterations in immune cell distribution induced by metastasis and exploring the molecular basis of the remodeling process. The aggregation of specific cell subpopulations in distinct regions not only modifies local immune characteristics but also concurrently affects global biological behaviors of liver metastatic tumors.

This study uncovers LDHB's role in countering mitochondria-associated ferroptosis independently of lactate's function as a carbon source. LDHB silencing alters mitochondrial morphology, causes lipid peroxidation, and reduces cancer cell viability, which is potentiated by the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. Unlike LDHA, LDHB acts in parallel with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) to suppress mitochondria-associated ferroptosis by decreasing the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ) to ubiquinol (CoQH2) ratio. Indeed, supplementation with mitoCoQH2 (mitochondria-targeted analogue of CoQH2) suppresses mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cell death after combined LDHB silencing and RSL3 treatment, consistent with the presence of LDHB in the cell fraction containing the mitochondrial inner membrane. Addressing the underlying molecular mechanism, an in vitro NADH consumption assay with purified human LDHB reveals that LDHB catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to CoQ and that the efficiency of this reaction increases by the addition of lactate. Finally, radiation therapy induces mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and reduces tumor growth, which is further enhanced when combined with LDHB silencing. Thus, LDHB-mediated lactate oxidation drives the CoQ-dependent suppression of mitochondria-associated ferroptosis, a promising target for combination therapies.",Nat Commun,16/03/2025

Initially, the assumption was that mitochondria primarily resided in the host cells and could exclusively transmit from oocytes to offspring by a mechanism known as vertical inheritance of mitochondria. Recent scholarly works, however, suggest that certain cell types transmit their mitochondria to other developmental cell types via a mechanism referred to as intercellular or horizontal mitochondrial transfer. This review details the process of which mitochondria are transferred across cells and explains the impact of mitochondrial transfer between cells on the efficacy and functionality of cancer cells in various cancer forms. Specifically, we review the role of mitochondria transfer in regulating cellular metabolism restoration, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, mitophagy activation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance, immune system modulation and therapeutic resistance in cancer.

Sex hormones are mainly produced in the gonads, but evidence suggests that they can also be locally synthesised in skeletal muscle. However, little is known about the purpose of intramuscular sex hormones and their role in skeletal muscle. This systematic review aimed to investigate 1) how intramuscular sex hormone concentrations vary across the lifespan, 2) whether exercise affects intramuscular sex hormone concentrations, and 3) whether intramuscular sex hormones are associated with skeletal muscle mass and function.Methods:Four databases were searched, and studies were included if they contained measurements of intramuscular sex hormones from healthy males and females free from any hormonal treatment or from rodents.Results:Thirteen studies were included. Intramuscular testosterone was reduced in older males compared to their younger counterparts, but comparison of intramuscular sex hormone concentrations between pre- and post-menopausal females yielded inconclusive findings. Chronic exercise decreased androgens and oestradiol in females, but increased androgens in males. Acute exercise did not change intramuscular hormone concentrations in humans but increased them in rodents. Intramuscular androgens were positively associated with muscle mass and strength in males. In females, conflicting findings were reported for both oestradiol and androgens, and measures of muscle mass and function.Conclusion:Current evidence suggests that ageing and exercise differentially modulate intramuscular sex hormone concentrations, and their association with muscle mass and function, between males and females, and model systems.",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,18/03/2025

Although tolerance to sedation is believed to develop, robust evidence documenting the timing of sedation onset and resolution remains elusive. To address this gap, we aimed to assess the dynamics of onset and resolution of sedation across various antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.Methods:In this meta-analysis, we included placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antipsychotic monotherapy for the acute phase of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. We searched PubMed for RCTs from inception until May 6, 2021 and obtained individual participant data of included trials through the Yale University Open Data Access project. We created Kaplan-Meier curves to assess the probability of onset of sedation and resolution from the incidence of sedation across time after treatment initiation. People with lived experience were not involved in this study. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022351647.Findings:We included a total of 6791 participants (4549 [67·0%] men and 2242 [33·0%] women, with a mean age of 38·0 years [SD 12·4, range 13-81], 1172 [17·3%] were Asian, 1626 [23·9%] were Black, 3654 [53·8%] were White, and 339 [5·0%] were other ethnicities) from 19 RCTs. Sedative adverse events were observed in 582 (8·6%) of 6791 participants and typically occurred shortly after treatment initiation. Among participants receiving antipsychotics, 418 (83%) of 505 sedation events occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Following the onset of sedation, 50% of symptoms were resolved within 1 week. After 4 weeks of treatment, 24% (95% CI 19·7-29·3) continued to have sedation with oral agents and 22·3% (15·3-32·3) with long-acting injectables.Interpretation:The high incidence of sedation within the first 2 weeks of treatment with antipsychotics emphasises the importance of early monitoring. Half of the sedation resolved within 1 week and 75% within 1 month, suggesting that tolerance to sedation is acquired quickly. If sedation is sustained, contributing factors should be evaluated.Funding:German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.",Lancet Psychiatry,00/00/0000
10.1200/EDBK-25-473636,State of the Art: Personalizing Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,"Wassim Abida, Himisha Beltran, Ruben Raychaudhuri","Until recently, the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) relied exclusively on hormonal therapies and taxane chemotherapy. The advent of modern molecular profiling methods applied in the clinic, namely, next-generation sequencing and advanced positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, has allowed for the development of biomarker-driven therapeutics including anti-PD-L1 therapy for microsatellite instability-high or tumor mutation burden-high disease, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with DNA damage repair mutations, and lutetium 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) for patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-avid disease. While these targeted therapies have improved outcomes, there is an opportunity to refine biomarkers to optimize patient selection, understand resistance, and develop novel combination strategies. In addition, studies in the laboratory and in patient-derived samples have shown that a subset of mCRPC tumors lose expression of common prostate cancer markers such as prostate-specific antigen and PSMA because of lineage plasticity and the development of non-androgen receptor (AR)-driven disease. Non-AR-driven prostate cancer has been associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, including in some cases histologic transformation to a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). The clinical management of NEPC typically follows the treatment paradigm for small cell lung cancer and increasingly relies on genomic and phenotypic characterization of disease, including loss of tumor suppressors and expression of cell surface markers such as DLL3. Therefore, both genomic subtyping and phenotypic subtyping are important to consider and can guide the clinical management of patients with advanced prostate cancer.",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,00/00/0000

While obligate diapause is genetically programmed, facultative diapause is typically triggered by environmental cues such as photoperiod. In insects, this often leads to reproductive diapause characterized by reduced juvenile hormone (JH) signaling, resulting in ovarian arrest and lipid accumulation. However, the molecular link between photoperiod and hormonal control remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the cabbage beetleColaphellus bowringias our model system. This species exhibits a photoperiodic response, where short-day (SD) conditions promote reproduction, whereas long-day (LD) conditions induce diapause. Our research identified the PBAP chromatin remodeling complex as a key regulator of LD-induced summer diapause entry. Through RNAi screening of 56 transcriptional regulators that were differentially expressed between SD and LD females, we identified BAP170, a PBAP-specific component, as a key mediator of diapause. Knockdown ofbap170in SD females induced reproductive diapause traits, which were reversed by treatment with methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting that the PBAP complex regulates diapause by influencing JH production. We further demonstrated that the PBAP complex modulates JH biosynthesis via SET1/COMPASS-mediated trimethylation of H3K4. Transcriptome analysis and a second RNAi screen identifiedcalmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein gene, as a direct target of PBAP-SET1/COMPASS-H3K4me3 signaling in the corpora allata (CA), the primary source of JH. These findings reveal how the chromatin remodeling machinery translates photoperiod signals into endocrine responses governing seasonal adaptation.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,25/03/2025

Objective of the study was to develop a sensitive, robust and simple method for simultaneous analysis of levosulpiride and omeprazole in human plasma and applicability of the method in determination of pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction. In the presented study, a reversed-phase HPLC-UV method was developed for the simultaneous determination of levosulpiride and omeprazole using pantoprazole as the internal standard. Experimental conditions were optimized and the developed method was validated as per standard guidelines (USP and ICH). Furthermore, the developed method was applied for evaluation of pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction between levosulpiride (50 mg) and omeprazole (40 mg) in healthy human volunteers. Sharpsil C8 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm), Ultisil C8 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) and Agilent C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) were evaluated as stationary phase. The best resolution was achieved with Agilent C18 (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 μm) column and was selected for further study. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in 60:40 by volume, and was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detector wavelength was set at 280 nm. Levosulpiride and omeprazole were extracted from human plasma with ethyl acetate and dichloromethane (4:1, v/v). The calibration curves for both levosulpiride (5-150 ng/mL) and omeprazole (10-1500 ng/mL) were linear. The lower limit of quantification and limit of detection for levosulpiride were 5 and 2 ng/mL, while for omeprazole these were 10 and 3 ng/mL, respectively. Pharmacokinetics analysis showed that co-administration of omeprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of levosulpiride, while the clearance was reduced. Both the changes were insignificant. Similarly, no significant change in the pharmacokinetic parameters of omeprazole was observed with co-administration of levosulpiride.",PLoS One,29/08/2024

However, it remains unknown whether targeting CCR2, the cognate receptor of CCL2, provides protection against human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Methods:Computationally predicted damaging or loss-of-function (REVEL > 0.5) variants within CCR2 were detected in whole-exome-sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants and tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints in gene-burden tests. Given the key role of CCR2 in monocyte mobilization, variants associated with lower monocyte count were prioritized for experimental validation. The response to CCL2 of human cells transfected with these variants was tested in migration and cAMP assays. Validated damaging variants were tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints, atherosclerosis burden, and vascular risk factors. Significant associations were replicated in six independent datasets (n = 1,062,595).Results:Carriers of 45 predicted damaging or loss-of-function CCR2 variants (n = 787 individuals) were at lower risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. One of these variants (M249K, n = 585, 0.15% of European ancestry individuals) was associated with lower monocyte count and with both decreased downstream signaling and chemoattraction in response to CCL2. While M249K showed no association with conventional vascular risk factors, it was consistently associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.81, p = 6.1 × 10-5) and coronary artery disease (OR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.63-0.87, p = 2.9 × 10-4) in the UK Biobank and in six replication cohorts. In a phenome-wide association study, there was no evidence of a higher risk of infections among M249K carriers.Conclusions:Carriers of an experimentally confirmed damaging CCR2 variant are at a lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease without carrying a higher risk of infections.

Suzetrigine, an oral, non-opioid, small molecule, selectively inhibits the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) and has potential to provide efficacious and safe relief for acute pain, without addiction concerns.Methods:To evaluate suzetrigine for treatment of acute pain, we conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain on the verbal categorical rating scale and ≥4 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after abdominoplasty (N=1118) or bunionectomy (N=1073). After surgery, participants were randomized to suzetrigine (100mg then 50mg every 12hrs), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP; 5/325mg every 6hrs), or placebo for 48 hours. The primary endpoint was time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference in NPRS from 0-48hrs (SPID48) versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints were SPID48 versus HB/APAP and time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS from baseline versus placebo.Results:The primary endpoint was achieved in both trials with suzetrigine demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain versus placebo. The least squares mean difference in SPID48 between suzetrigine and placebo was 48.4 (95%CI:33.6,63.1;P<0.0001) after abdominoplasty and 29.3 (95%CI:14.0,44.6; P=0.0002) after bunionectomy. Neither trial achieved the first key secondary endpoint of superiority of suzetrigine versus HB/APAP on SPID48. For the second key secondary endpoint of time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS, suzetrigine had a more rapid onset of clinically meaningful pain relief versus placebo after abdominoplasty (119min versus 480mins, nominal P<0.0001) and bunionectomy (240mins versus 480mins, nominal P=0.0016).Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those seen in post-surgical settings.Conclusions:As compared with placebo, suzetrigine reduced moderate-to-severe acute pain over 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. Pain reduction with suzetrigine was similar to that with HB/APAP. Suzetrigine was associated with adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity.Clinicaltrialsgov registration:NCT05558410andNCT05553366.",Anesthesiology,21/03/2025

In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the BCL2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of BH3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tools targeting the BH4 domain of BCL2. The first BCL2-selective BH3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar BCL2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination. Genetic analysis highlights the importance of BCL-XLand MCL1 across different cancer types and the possible utility of BH3-mimetics targeting these proteins. However, the development of BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-XLor MCL1 has been more challenging, with on-target toxicities including thrombocytopenia for BCL-XLand cardiac toxicities for MCL1 inhibitors precluding clinical development. Tumor-specific BCL-XLor MCL1 inhibition may be achieved by novel targeting approaches using PROTACs or selective drug delivery strategies and would be transformational in many subtypes of malignancy. Taken together, we envision that the targeting of BCL2 proteins, while already a success story of translational research, may in the foreseeable future have broader clinical applicability and improve the treatment of multiple diseases.",Signal Transduct Target Ther,21/03/2025

The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 inPlasmodium berghei(PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption ofpbsip2resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN4-6GTGCA).

We compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of isodose MHFRT and dose-escalated MHFRT.Methods:This was an individual patient data meta-analysis that identified randomised phase 3 trials of CFRT versus MHFRT that had published individual patient-level data on efficacy and late toxicity. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, the Web of Science, Scopus, and relevant conference proceedings was initially conducted on Dec 15, 2023, and was re-conducted on Jan 8, 2025. Trials that did not publish efficacy data, did not publish late toxicity data, or did not use modern dose radiotherapy (≥70 Gy in 2 Gy equivalents) in the CFRT group were excluded. Individual patient data were provided to MARCAP by study investigators. Three separate meta-analyses were designed to compare efficacy (primary endpoint was progression-free survival), physician-scored late toxicity (co-primary endpoints were late grade 2 or higher genitourinary and late grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal toxic effects), and patient-reported outcomes (co-primary endpoints were clinically-significant decrements in patient-reported urinary or bowel quality of life) between patients receiving CFRT versus MHFRT.Findings:We identified 1696 records for review. Seven phase 3 trials comparing MHFRT with CFRT were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. Individual patient data were obtained from these seven studies (3454 patients from three trials comparing CFRT with isodose MHFRT and 2426 patients from four trials comparing CFRT with dose-escalated MHFRT). At a median follow-up of 5·4 years (IQR 4·6-7·2) for isodose MHFRT and 7·1 years (5·7-8·4) for dose-escalated MHFRT, no differences in progression-free survival were detected (hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·81-1·05; p=0·21 and 0·94, 0·82-1·09; p=0·43 respectively). No increased odds of grade 2 or higher genitourinary toxic effects were identified for either isodose (odds ratio [OR] 1·16, 95 CI% 0·86-1·57; p=0·32) or dose-escalated MHFRT (1·20, 0·95-1·51; p=0·13). The odds of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal toxic effects were significantly higher with dose-escalated (OR 1·48, 95% CI 1·14-1·92; p=0·0035) but not isodose MHFRT (1·30, 0·59-2·87; p=0·51). Isodose MHFRT was not found to show different odds of urinary quality-of-life decrement (OR 1·03, 95% CI 0·51-2·09; p=0·93) or bowel quality-of-life decrement (0·76, 0·40-1·43; p=0·39). Dose-escalated MHFRT was associated with greater odds of bowel quality-of-life decrement (OR 1·68, 95% CI 1·07-2·61; p=0·023), but no evidence of greater urinary quality-of-life decrement was found (1·57, 0·87-2·85; p=0·13).Interpretation:Isodose MHFRT and dose-escalated MHFRT both have similar efficacy compared with CFRT, but dose-escalated MHFRT is associated with higher physician-scored and patient-reported bowel toxicity.

Recently, albumin-binding motif-modified PSMA radioligands with prolonged blood circulation were developed to improve tumor uptake and therapeutic effectiveness, properties which, however, were associated with an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity. This study presents new PSMA-targeted radioligands incorporating dansylated amino acids as relatively weak and preferable albumin binders to achieve a fine balance between increased tumor accumulation, safety, and diagnostic efficacy, facilitating a unified approach to theranostics within a single molecular framework.Methods:Three novel PSMA ligands ([68Ga]Ga-Dan-Gly-PSMA, [68Ga]Ga-Dan-Nva-PSMA, and [68Ga]Ga-Dan-Phe-PSMA, denoted as [68Ga]Ga-LNC1011) were synthesized with dansylated amino acids and measured the albumin-binding properties with human serum albumin through ultrafiltration experiments. Binding affinity and PSMA-targeting specificity were investigated using a saturation binding assay and cell uptake in the PSMA-induced prostate cancer 3 cell line (PC3-PIP). PET imaging in PC3-PIP tumor-bearing mice was performed to evaluate the preclinical pharmacokinetics and diagnostic efficiency of68Ga-labeled PSMA ligands. Tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1011 was evaluated through SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies. Radiopharmaceutical therapy studies were conducted to systematically assess the therapeutic effect of the radioligand.Results:Three novel PSMA radioligands ([68Ga]Ga-Dan-Gly-PSMA, [68Ga]Ga-Dan-Nva-PSMA, and [68Ga]Ga-LNC1011) with various dansylated amino acids were successfully synthesized with a radiochemical yield greater than 97%. In the PC3-PIP xenograft tumor model, the tumor/heart, tumor/liver, tumor/kidney, and tumor/muscle ratios were 9.82 ± 2.35, 12.42 ± 3.71, 4.36 ± 0.29, and 52.88 ± 12.08 at 4 h after injection, respectively. Biodistribution studies confirmed the significantly higher tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1011 (127.36 ± 16.95 %ID/g) over [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (17.44 ± 6.29 %ID/g) at 4 h after injection, and no decrease was measured for the [177Lu]Lu-LNC1011 at up to 72 h after injection, which was corroborated with SPECT imaging. A single injection of 9.3 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1011 achieved 89.43% inhibition of tumor growth, equivalent to 18.5 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (90.87%). [68Ga]Ga-LNC1011 PET/CT scans of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer identified as many lesions as [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 did, confirming its diagnostic efficacy.Conclusion:68Ga/177Lu-LNC1011, characterized by high tumor uptake and retention along with timely clearance from normal organs and tissues, thus emerges as a promising single-molecule theranostic radioligand.",J Nucl Med,20/03/2025

Therefore, timely diagnosis of LC in CHB patients is crucial.Objective:This study aimed to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LC in CHB patients by integrating liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with traditional indicators.Methods:The study participants were randomly divided into training and internal validation sets. Employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) for feature selection, we developed both traditional logistic regression and five machine learning models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest (RF), artificial neural network, support vector machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Performance evaluation included receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves and decision curve analysis. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was employed to improve the interpretability of the optimal model.Results:We retrospectively included 1609 patients with CHB, among whom 470 were diagnosed with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on histological confirmation or clinical assessment, supported by characteristic findings on abdominal ultrasound and corroborative evidence such as thrombocytopenia, varices or imaging from CT/MRI. In the internal validation, the RF model achieved an accuracy above 0.80 and an AUC above 0.80, with outstanding calibration ability and clinical net benefit. Additionally, the model exhibited excellent predictive performance in an independent external validation set. The SHAP analysis indicated that LSM contributed the most to the model. The model still showed strong discriminative power when using only LSM or traditional indicators alone.Conclusions:Machine learning models, especially the RF model, can effectively identify LC in CHB patients. Integrating LSM with traditional indicators can enhance diagnostic performance.",Ann Med,00/00/0000

Despite the widespread recommendation for physical activity (PA) in management, the heterogeneity of PA prescriptions limits the in-depth evaluation of its efficacy. By triangulating clinical interventional evidence with human genetic evidence, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of influencing factors such as PA mode, course of treatment, and intensity on PA in the prevention and treatment of CWP.Methods:Ten international and regional databases were searched for articles published between January 2014 and July 2024. Randomized control trials with CWP or fibromyalgia as an entry criterion and PA as an intervention were included. Meta-analyses were performed using fixed- or random-effects models based on heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the effects of the genetic variants linked to PA intensity on CWP risk.Results:The analysis included 11 studies with 540 participants. PA effectively improved pain perception (MD: -1.47; 95% CI: -2.23, -0.72), depression (MD: -4.77; 95% CI: -7.40, -2.14), and overall quality of life (SMD: -1.43; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.69). MR analysis revealed that several PA intensities were associated with reduced susceptibility to CWP: walking for pleasure (OR: 0.950; 95% CI: 0.934-0.966), light do-it-yourself (DIY) (OR: 0.976; 95% CI: 0.961-0.992), strenuous sports (OR: 0.923; 95% CI: 0.880-0.967), and other exercises (OR: 0.957; 95% CI: 0.942-0.973).Conclusion:PA interventions are beneficial for reducing pain perception and mood disorders and enhancing the quality of life of patients with CWP. A treatment course of approximately three months is preferable, with Ba-Duan-Jin potentially more effective than other PAs, and high-intensity PA offers the most significant protective effect against CWP.",J Pain Res,14/03/2025
10.1182/blood.2024027376,PI3Kγ in leukemia: class IB PI3 kinase reemerges as a cancer-intrinsic target,"Qingyu Luo, Amanda L Fortune, Andrew A Lane","Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), the only class IB PI3 kinase, is a cell-extrinsic immunotherapy target in solid tumors. PI3Kγ inhibition reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid cells to acquire immunostimulatory phenotypes, which promote antitumor cytotoxic T cell activity. Although PI3Kγ inhibition has no direct effect on solid tumor cells, several new studies have nominated PI3Kγ as a cell-intrinsic target in various leukemias, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Intrinsic dependency on PI3Kγ is present at baseline in leukemias with specific pathologic characteristics, is inducible by extrinsic inflammation in others, and may also be acquired with resistance to certain therapies. The discovery of leukemia PI3Kγ dependency has generated enthusiasm for immediate clinical trial evaluation of inhibitor monotherapy and combinations. Parallel laboratory evaluation is needed to develop an improved understanding of leukemia disease features associated with clinical inhibitor sensitivity that might suggest biomarker-directed patient enrichment strategies. In this review, we discuss recent progress credentialling PI3Kγ as a bona fide target in leukemia. We also highlight open questions, including a need to understand the mechanism of acquired resistance to PI3Kγ inhibition, how to optimally prioritize combination therapies to enhance PI3Kγ inhibitor utility, and how cell-extrinsic effects of PI3Kγ inhibition in the leukemia microenvironment might also contribute to clinical activity.",Blood,19/03/2025

Understanding this risk can provide a more comprehensive assessment of long-term health across the lifespan of survivors and guide adult care.Objective:To estimate the lifetime risks of 8 treatment-related cancers and cardiovascular conditions among childhood cancer survivors and compare them with the general population.Design, setting, participants:Using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and national databases, this simulation modeling study projected long-term outcomes for 5-year survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1999 based on treatment exposures and age-related risks. The general population comparator was simulated using age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched individuals who faced only age-related risks.Exposures:Treatment era (1970s, 1980s, 1990s), original cancer diagnosis, radiation treatment for primary diagnosis (any, none).Main outcomes and measures:Estimated lifetime risks of 8 health conditions (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, glial tumors, sarcomas, heart failure, coronary heart disease/myocardial infarction, stroke, and valvular disease). Risks were projected and compared with the general population, stratified by radiation exposure.Results:In the general population, 20% developed at least 1 health condition by age 65.0 years; in 5-year survivors this threshold was reached at age 47.3 years, representing a 17.7-year (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 14.0-21.0) acceleration in disease onset. By age 65 years, 55% of survivors were projected to develop at least 1 condition, indicating a 2.7-fold (95% UI, 2.2-3.5) higher relative risk and 34.2% (95% UI, 28.3-42.5) absolute excess risk compared with the general population. Risks were higher among those treated with radiation therapy for childhood cancer (22.0 years earlier onset [95% UI, 18.0-25.0]; 37.3% excess risk [95% UI, 31.6%-44.7%]) but still elevated for those without radiation exposure (13.5 years earlier onset [95% UI, 10.0-16.0]; 31.0% excess risk [95% UI, 23.9%-40.3%]). Reaching middle age was still associated with increased health risks. Compared with the general population, survivors who reached age 40 years had a 6.2-fold higher risk (95% UI, 4.8-9.4) of developing a new condition within 10 years.Conclusions and relevance:This study found that survivors of childhood cancer experience accelerated onset of aging-related diseases, regardless of prior radiation exposure. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention among survivors decades earlier than for the general population.",JAMA Oncol,20/03/2025

With footprint profiling, we delineate two dominant IFN-I faces commonly recognized by neutralizing IFN-I autoantibody-containing plasmas from aged individuals with HIV-1 and from individuals with severe COVID-19. These faces overlap with IFN-I regions independently essential for engaging the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 heterodimer, and neutralizing plasmas efficiently block the interaction of IFN-I with both receptor subunits in vitro. In contrast, non-neutralizing autoantibody-containing plasmas limit the interaction of IFN-I with only one receptor subunit and display relatively low IFN-I-binding avidities, thus likely hindering neutralizing function. Iterative engineering of signaling-inert mutant IFN-Is (simIFN-Is) retaining dominant autoantibody targets created potent decoys that prevent IFN-I neutralization by autoantibody-containing plasmas and that restore IFN-I-mediated antiviral activity. Additionally, microparticle-coupled simIFN-Is were effective at depleting IFN-I autoantibodies from plasmas, leaving antiviral antibodies unaffected. Our study reveals mechanisms of action for IFN-I autoantibodies and demonstrates a proof-of-concept strategy to alleviate pathogenic effects.",J Exp Med,02/06/2025
10.1111/pai.70060,An update on the diagnosis and management of non-IgE-mediated food allergies in children,"Rosan Meyer, Antonella Cianferoni, Marta Vazquez-Ortiz","The spectrum of non-IgE mediated conditions includes well-defined conditions like Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), Eosinophilic Oesophagitis (EoE), Food Protein-Induced Enteropathy, and Food Protein-Induced Allergic Proctocolitis, but also the more controversial food protein-induced dysmotility disorders like food protein-induced gastroesophageal reflux disease (FPGORD) and food protein-induced constipation (FPC). Typically, non-IgE mediated reactions are delayed, with symptom onset from hours to days after exposure to a culprit food. The diagnosis is mostly clinical, and food elimination followed by reintroduction is the primary diagnostic method. Apart from EoE, the diagnosis of these conditions remains challenging, and there is a need to develop specific diagnostic tests. Acute FPIES presents with distinct symptoms, but misdiagnosis is common due to poor recognition. In contrast, some presentations, particularly FPGORD and FPC, overlap with the common, often benign disorders of gut-brain interaction, previously known as functional gastrointestinal disorders. This raises concerns about overdiagnosis and can lead to an unnecessary restrictive diet in infants and breastfeeding mothers. A systematic approach to an elimination diet and the support of a registered dietitian/nutritionist are recommended to ensure nutritional adequacy, suitable alternatives, promote timely introductions when appropriate, support breastfeeding where required as well as prevent nutritional deficiencies and feeding difficulties. This publication aims to provide an update on the spectrum of non-IgE-mediated food allergic conditions and intends to provide clinicians with practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of each condition.

The outbreak of immune inflammation in the lung is an important pathogenic mechanism of ARDS. Notably, an imbalance in macrophage polarization is an important link in the occurrence and development of this inflammatory response. Recently, neuropeptides have been shown to regulate inflammation, but the role of neuropeptides in ARDS remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on the inflammatory response in ARDS. We found that CGRP expression was increased in the serum of ARDS patients and in both in vitro and in vivo models of ARDS. CGRP can regulate the polarization of macrophages by targeting its receptor (receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1)), reduce the proportion of M1 macrophages, increase the proportion of M2 macrophages, and reduce pathological injury, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in lung tissue in LPS-induced ARDS both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we performed transcriptome sequencing and found that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is involved in the above process and that CGRP can alleviate ARDS-related pathological damage, inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting the HIF-1α pathway to regulate macrophage polarization balance. These results indicate that CGRP has good potential for clinical translation in the treatment of pulmonary infection in ARDS. Furthermore, this study provides new ideas for the treatment of inflammatory bursts in ARDS.",Clin Sci (Lond),20/03/2025

In this study, a total of 1463 plasma proteins were measured by the Olink Explore platform for 50,553 participants in a large prospective cohort. Four air pollutants were assessed using land-use regression models: particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5μm (PM2.5), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter > 2.5μm and ≤ 10μm (PM2.5-10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitric oxide (NO). The air pollution index was calculated using principal components analysis to assess joint exposure to air pollution. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were respectively used to explore the impact of the interaction between air pollution exposure and plasma proteins on the prevalence and incidence of depression. Functional enrichment analysis and drug prediction analysis were conducted to explore the biological mechanisms and drugs associated with identified plasma proteins with interaction effects. Logistic regression analysis detected seven significant air pollutant and plasma protein interactions for the prevalence of depression, such as CDHR5 vs. PM2.5(OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.48-0.71), TNFRSF13C vs. NO (OR :0.70, 95% CI: 0.58-0.84) and ICAM5 vs. air pollution index (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.17-1.63). Two significant interactions were identified for the incidence of depression: CDHR5 vs. PM2.5(HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.50-0.76) and HSD11B1 vs. PM2.5(HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.22-1.81). The plasma proteins that interacted with air pollutants were enriched in various Gene Ontology terms and pathways involving immunity, endocrine, inflammation, neurological function and metabolism, such as neuroinflammatory response, neuron projection guidance, regulation of lymphocyte mediated immunity, steroid biosynthetic process and lipid digestion. We also found that these proteins interacted with multiple drugs, such as risperidone, olanzapine and progesterone.

Over 95% of GBM patients experience recurrence in the peritumoral brain tissue or distant regions, indicating the presence of critical factors in these areas that drive tumor recurrence. Current clinical treatments primarily focus on tumor cells from the tumor core (TC), while the role of neoplastic cells beyond the TC has been largely neglected.Methods:We conducted a comprehensive review of existing literature and studies on GBM, focusing on the identification and characterization of questionable cells (Q cells). Advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET), were utilized to identify Q cells beyond the tumor core. We also analyzed the functional properties, cellular microenvironment, and physical characteristics of Q cells, as well as their implications for surgical resection.Results:Our review revealed that Q cells exhibit unique functional attributes, including enhanced invasiveness, metabolic adaptations, and resistance mechanisms. These cells reside in a distinct cellular microenvironment and are influenced by physical properties such as solid stress and stiffness. Advanced imaging techniques have improved the identification of Q cells, enabling more precise surgical resection. Targeting Q cells in therapeutic strategies could significantly reduce the risk of GBM recurrence.Conclusion:The presence of Q cells in the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ) and beyond is a critical factor in GBM recurrence. Current treatments, which primarily target tumor cells in the TC, are insufficient to prevent recurrence due to the neglect of Q cells. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms influencing Q cells and developing targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes.",CNS Neurosci Ther,00/00/0000

The authors convened an international panel of 24 rTMS experts, representative of different geographic regions and subspecialities, and created a consensus guideline for clinicians and researchers on approaches to concurrent substance use in patients receiving rTMS as treatment for primary psychiatric disorders.Methods:A Delphi method survey and expert opinion elicited over consecutive rounds of surveys were used, with feedback and discussion after each round. Recommendation statements were established upon very high (≥80%) agreement.Results:Three rounds of surveys and feedback were sufficient to reach a consensus for most topics; where consensus could not be reached, the panel discussed limitations in the current evidence base. Informed by a synthesis of the literature and practice-based evidence, the expert panel provides several consensus recommendations on the topics of screening, monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation associated with various degrees of substance use, and specific considerations for alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and opioids. Instead of excluding all people who use substances, a nuanced approach should be taken based on an assessment of risk factors for clinical instability and severity of use. The most important safety risk with substance use is the presence of intoxication or withdrawal states, with the most data supporting seizure risk in unstable alcohol or nonmedical stimulant use. Although there is no evidence of reduced rTMS efficacy for a psychiatric disorder in the presence of concurrent substance use, the lack of data in this area warrants caution.Conclusions:These recommendations can be readily implemented clinically and provide a framework for future research. In patients receiving rTMS for a primary psychiatric disorder, assessment and management of co-occurring substance use is complex, requiring greater attention, standardization, and further study.",Am J Psychiatry,19/03/2025

Of the multifaceted etiological factors, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a prominent contributor to CKD.Materials and methods:We analysed the global incidence, prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) with age-standardised rates of CKD due to T1DM (CKD-T1DM) in 2021, stratified by subtype. We calculated the temporal trends in the infirmity burden from 1990 to 2019 using a linear regression model. The age-period-cohort (APC) and Bayesian APC models predicted the prospective burden over the next 25 years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing models.Results:Globally, there were 95 140 incidences, 6 295 711 prevalence cases, 94 020 deaths and 3 875 628 DALYs due to CKD-T1DM. Males and young-to-middle-aged individuals were more likely to be affected by CKD-T1DM. The middle-socio-demographic index regions were at higher risk. A considerable variation in disease burden was observed across the Global Burden of Disease super regions and countries. The number of patients with CKD-T1DM surged globally from 1990 to 2021. The projections indicated a continuous increase until 2046, driven by ageing populations and unmet therapeutic needs in low-resource settings.Conclusions:CKD-T1DM poses a growing public health threat, necessitating region-specific strategies that address healthcare inequities, promote early screening and prioritise nephroprotective therapies among T1DM populations.",Diabetes Obes Metab,21/03/2025

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are formed by a process known as ""NETosis"" that has been implicated in AAA pathogenesis, yet the roles and prognostic significance of NET-related genes in AAA remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify key AAA- and NET-related genes (AAA-NETs-RGs), elucidate their potential mechanisms in contributing to AAA, and explore potential therapeutic compounds for AAA therapy. Through bioinformatics analysis of multiomics and machine learning, we identified six AAA-NETs-RGs: DUSP26, FCN1, MTHFD2, GPRC5C, SEMA4A, and CCR7, which exhibited strong diagnostic potential for predicting AAA progression, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a causal association between AAA-NETs-RGs and immune cell infiltration. Cell-cell communication analysis indicated that AAA-NETs-RGs predominantly function in smooth muscle cells, B cells, T cells, and NK cells, primarily through cytokine and chemokine signaling. Gene profiling revealed that CCR7 and MTHFD2 exhibited the most significant upregulation in AAA patients compared to non-AAA controls, as well as inin vitroAAA models. Notably, genetic depletion of CCR7 and MTHFD2 strongly inhibited Ang II-induced phenotypic switching, functional impairment, and senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Based on AAA-NETs-RGs, molecular docking analysis combined with the Connectivity Map (CMap) database identified mirdametinib as a potential therapeutic agent for AAA.

Clinical and epidemiologic features implicate an infectious cause but specific antigenic targets of the disease are unknown. Peripheral blood plasmablasts are normally highly clonally diverse but the antibodies they encode are approximately 70% antigen-specific 1-2 weeks after infection.Methods:We isolated single peripheral blood plasmablasts from children with KD 1-3 weeks after onset and prepared 60 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We used the mAbs to identify their target antigens and assessed serologic response among KD patients and controls to specific antigen.Results:Thirty-two mAbs from 9 of 11 patients recognize antigen within intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells of fatal cases. Five of these mAbs, from 3 patients with coronary aneurysms, recognize a specific peptide, which blocks binding to inclusion bodies. Sera from 5/8 KD patients day ≥ 8 after illness onset, compared with 0/17 infant controls (P < .01), recognized the KD peptide antigen.Conclusions:These results identify a protein epitope targeted by the antibody response to KD and provide a means to elucidate the pathogenesis of this important worldwide pediatric problem.",J Infect Dis,16/06/2020

This study investigated the effects of VEE on inflammatory markers (IMs) and COs. It further evaluated the association between acute changes in IMs and COs at follow-up in individuals with first-ever mild-to-moderate ischaemic stroke.Methods:A prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (retrospectively registered: PACTR202406755848901; 10-06-2024) was conducted. Forty-eight patients randomized (1:1) into the VEE group (VEEG) and usual care group (UCG) completed the follow-up. Within 24 h of stroke onset, patients in VEEG underwent 45 min of VEE twice daily, amounting to 1.5 h/d, for seven days while patients in UCG received regular turning and positioning. The levels of IMs including interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were assessed at baseline, 4th, and 7th day for both groups. Thereafter, each patient received 90-min follow-up physiotherapy twice weekly for three months. Motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were evaluated at 1st and 3rd month of follow-up.Results:On the 4th and 7th day, patients in VEEG show trends of lower levels of IL-6, leucocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes and higher levels of lymphocytes. However, a non-linear effect of VEE on plasma fibrinogen was observed compared to UC. Furthermore, better improvement in motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were observed in VEEG. The positive modulation of IMs by VEE was associated with COs over time, including associations between changes in IL-6 at days 4 and 7 and 3-month functional independence (rs= -0.33; p = 0.019; rs= -0.33; p = 0.021), and at day 7 and 3-month motor impairment (rs= 0.30; p = 0.039).Conclusions:Initiating moderate-intensity exercise within 24 h appears beneficial in positively modulating IMs, including IL-6, at the acute stage and improving the physical, motor, cognitive, and affective functions at 1-and 3-month follow-up. The association between exercise-induced acute changes in IMs and improved COs over time highlights the potential role of moderate-intensity VEE in enhancing stroke recovery through positive inflammatory modulation.",BMC Neurol,21/03/2025
10.1186/s13054-025-05343-5,Ventilation-induced acute kidney injury in acute respiratory failure: Do PEEP levels matter?,"Martín H Benites, Fernando Suarez-Sipmann, Eduardo Kattan, Pablo Cruces, Jaime Retamal","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients, and mechanical ventilation (MV) plays a critical role in its management. One of the key parameters of MV is the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which helps to maintain an adequate lung functional volume. However, the optimal level of PEEP remains controversial. The classical approach in clinical trials for identifying the optimal PEEP has been to compare ""high"" and ""low"" levels in a dichotomous manner. High PEEP can improve lung compliance and significantly enhance oxygenation but has been inconclusive in hard clinical outcomes such as mortality and duration of MV. This discrepancy could be related to the fact that inappropriately high or low PEEP levels may adversely affect other organs, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which could counteract its potential beneficial effects on the lung. Patients with ARDS often develop acute kidney injury, which is an independent marker of mortality. Three primary mechanisms have been proposed to explain lung-kidney crosstalk during MV: gas exchange abnormalities, such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia; remote biotrauma; and hemodynamic changes, including reduced venous return and cardiac output. As PEEP levels increase, lung volume expands to a variable extent depending on mechanical response. This dynamic underlies two potential mechanisms that could impair venous return, potentially leading to splanchnic and renal congestion. First, increasing PEEP may enhance lung aeration, particularly in highly recruitable lungs, where previously collapsed alveoli reopen, increasing lung volume and pleural pressure, leading to vena cava compression, which can contribute to systemic venous congestion and abdominal organ impairment function. Second, in lungs with low recruitability, PEEP elevation may induce minimal changes in lung volume while increasing airway pressure, resulting in alveolar overdistension, vascular compression, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, we propose that high PEEP settings can contribute to renal congestion, potentially impairing renal function. This review underscores the need for further rigorous research to validate these perspectives and explore strategies for optimizing PEEP settings while minimizing adverse renal effects.",Crit Care,21/03/2025

Here, we show that bacteria releasing enzymes responsible for secondary BAMs production are under-represented in the gut of MS patients, resulting in significantly reduced intestinal concentration of DCA and immune dysregulation with increased percentage of Th17 cells. We validated our human findings in a preclinical model of MS by showing that DCA/LCA administration prevents experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by dampening Th17 cell differentiation and the effector phenotype of myelin-reactive T cells.

However, few studies have investigated the correlation between HGI and prognosis in patients with critical ischemic stroke.Methods:A cohort of patients was established from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate regression models, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to investigate the associations between HGI and different outcomes. Mediation models were constructed to determine the mediating role of white blood cell (WBC) counts.Results:This study included 2,332 participants. In-hospital mortality differs significantly across HGI groups (24.43 %, 11.82 %, and 10.14 %, P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analyses found that lower HGI was significantly associated with greater mortality risk. Nonlinear analyses revealed an L-shaped association between HGI and short-term mortality (30-day and in-hospital), while a reverse J-shaped relationship emerged for long-term (365-day) mortality. Mediation analysis revealed that WBC counts mediated the association with proportions (%) of 33.73, 19.65, and 30.00, respectively.Conclusion:Lower HGI is consistently related to poorer outcomes in patients with critical ischemic stroke.

This study investigated the impact of gut microbiota on intrahepatic metastasis of HCC and evaluated the therapeutic potential of healthy fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by a significant reduction in the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such asAnaerotruncus colihominisandDysosmobacter welbionis, was observed in patients with intrahepatic metastatic HCC. A human flora-associated (HFA) intrahepatic metastatic HCC mouse model was successfully established through consecutive 4 weeks of human-mouse FMT. Dysregulation of gut microbiota promoted intrahepatic metastasis in the mouse model, primarily by enhancing neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and lead to excessive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Consequently, it promoted tumor vascular growth and tissue necrosis, resulting in intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Notably, FMT from healthy donors mitigated these pathological processes. This study elucidated the role and mechanism of dysregulated gut microbiota in promoting intrahepatic metastasis of HCC.

The immunoplatform is constructed using screen-printed electrodes where capture antibody is immobilized through the chemistry of diazonium salts. CeO2NPs exhibit robust pseudo-peroxidase activity even at high substrate concentrations. They are covalently functionalized in a simple manner after carboxylation with a detector antibody (dAb), acting dually as a nanozyme and nanocarrier for sensing bioreceptors. This allows the development of immunoplatforms with improved robustness and performance (in terms of a moderate enhancement in sensitivity, a significant expansion in the linear range, and a reduction in the background current) compared with the immunoplatforms prepared using nanolabels also decorated with the natural enzyme (horseradish peroxidase, HRP) or the conventional enzymatic labeling involving the dAb and an HRP-secondary antibody. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the developed electrochemical immunoplatform allows the highly sensitive detection of the TIM-1 glycoprotein, with a detection limit of 9.9 pg mL-1and a linear working range of 33-600 pg mL-1. This performance permits biomarker quantification within clinically relevant ranges.

While molecular methods offer significant advantages over traditional clinical-pathological evaluations, they lack standardized diagnostic protocols and validated prognostic value. This study systematically compared the diagnostic and prognostic performance of molecular methods versus clinical-pathological evaluations in diagnosing multiple lung cancers (MLCs), specifically focusing on the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) parameters on diagnostic accuracy. A review of 41 studies encompassing 1266 patients revealed that two molecular methods, Mole1 (manually counting shared mutations) and Mole2 (bioinformatics-assisted clonal probability calculation), both demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy and prognostic discrimination capabilities. Molecular assessment, particularly Mole1, effectively stratified prognosis for MPLC and IPM, leading to significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS: HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15-0.39) and overall survival (OS: HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58). Further analysis suggests that a minimal panel of 30-50 genes may be sufficient to effectively differentiate prognoses. Compared to Mole1, Mole2 demonstrated greater specificity and stability across various panels, achieving AUC values from 0.962 to 0.979. Clinical-pathological evaluations proved unreliable, not only failing to distinguish prognosis effectively but also exhibiting a potential misdiagnosis rate of 35.5% and 33.6% compared to the reference diagnosis. To improve both cost-effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy, bioinformatics-assisted molecular diagnostics should be integrated into multidisciplinary assessments, especially for high-risk cases where diagnostic errors are common.",Thorac Cancer,00/00/0000

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identify adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of middle-aged subjects as potential causes of midlife obesity. Specifically, the extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from APCs display an impaired ability to mitigate the inflammaging of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in middle-aged individuals. Mechanistically, these EVs, lacking miR-145-5p, fail to suppress the expression of L-selectin in ATMs, thereby facilitating their M1 program via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In contrast, EVs from young APCs effectively inhibit M1 macrophage polarization. Accordingly, targeted liposomes are designed to deliver miR-145-5p mimics to ATMs, which effectively prevent the obesity in middle-aged mice.

Currently, dosimetry using SPECT/CT-imaging is the most preferred method. However, SPECT/CT is a time-consuming procedure and comprises additional radiation exposure to the patient. Moreover, not every therapeutic nuclear medicine facility has access to SPECT/CT. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure of kidney dosimetry without the use of SPECT/CT and evaluate this method in a large cohort of patients with mCRPC undergoing RLT.Procedures:A dedicated torso phantom with kidneys filled with a solution of177Lu-PSMA was used for quantitative calibration of a SPECT-camera. The calculated sensitivity was adapted according to the individual attenuation of the patient in four directions from the kidney surface to the body surface (ventral, dorsal, left and right) obtained from a previously performed CT. A total of 196 patients undergoing 926 cycles of177Lu-PSMA therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Abdominal SPECT was performed 24, 48 and 72 h after administration of177Lu-PSMA including scatter and dead-time correction in every patient. Kidney dose was calculated using an individual attenuation-based procedure and compared to values from international literature.Results:Volumes of interest of the kidneys were drawn in the three sequential SPECT-images to calculate intra-renal effective half-life. Absolute quantification of activity in the kidneys was accomplished obtaining a patient individual sensitivity based on the individual attenuation in the patient. Kidney dose was then calculated applying a bi-exponential time activity curve in Microsoft EXCEL. Mean kidney dose per administered activity was 0.54 (± 0.26) Gy/GBq.Conclusions:With the presented procedure a reliable kidney dosimetry is possible without the use of SPECT/CT.

10.1038/s41587-025-02565-4,Spatial genomics of AAV vectors reveals mechanism of transcriptional crosstalk that enables targeted delivery of large genetic cargo,"Gerard M Coughlin, Máté Borsos, Bre'Anna H Barcelona, Nathan Appling, Acacia M H Mayfield, Elisha D Mackey, Rana A Eser, Cameron R Jackson, Xinhong Chen, Sripriya Ravindra Kumar, Viviana Gradinaru","Cell-type-specific regulatory elements such as enhancers can direct expression of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to specific cell types, but this approach is limited by the relatively small packaging capacity of AAVs. In this study, we used spatial genomics to show that transcriptional crosstalk between individual AAV genomes provides a general method for cell-type-specific expression of large cargo by separating distally acting regulatory elements into a second AAV genome. We identified and profiled transcriptional crosstalk in AAV genomes carrying 11 different enhancers active in mouse brain. We developed spatial genomics methods to identify and localize AAV genomes and their concatemeric forms in cultured cells and in tissue, and we demonstrate here that transcriptional crosstalk is dependent upon concatemer formation. Finally, we leveraged transcriptional crosstalk to drive expression of a 3.2-kb Cas9 cargo in a cell-type-specific manner with systemically administered engineered AAVs, and we demonstrate AAV-delivered, minimally invasive, cell-type-specific gene editing in wild-type mice that recapitulates known disease phenotypes.",Nat Biotechnol,20/03/2025
